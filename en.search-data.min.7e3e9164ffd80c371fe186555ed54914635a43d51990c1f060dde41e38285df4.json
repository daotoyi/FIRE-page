I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let\u0026rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we\u0026rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.\n$ ls -l public total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 416 Sep 29 17:02 index.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 262 Sep 29 17:02 sitemap.xml $ Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.\nTest the New Site Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this.

The homepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.\nList and Single Templates In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026quot;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Let\u0026rsquo;s verify that by creating an \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page at the top level:\n$ vi content/about.md +++ title = \u0026quot;about\u0026quot; description = \u0026quot;about this site\u0026quot; date = \u0026quot;2014-09-27\u0026quot; slug = \u0026quot;about time\u0026quot; +++ ## about us i'm speechless :wq Generate the web site and verify the results.\n$ find public -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-rw-r-- 1 mdhender staff 334 Sep 27 15:08 public/about-time/index.html -rw-rw-r-- 1 mdhender staff 527 Sep 27 15:08 public/index.html -rw-rw-r-- 1 mdhender staff 358 Sep 27 15:08 public/post/first-post/index.html -rw-rw-r-- 1 mdhender staff 0 Sep 27 15:08 public/post/index.html -rw-rw-r-- 1 mdhender staff 342 Sep 27 15:08 public/post/second-post/index.html Notice that the page wasn\u0026rsquo;t created at the top level.

Hugo lets \u0026ldquo;slug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;URL\u0026rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026quot;theme/partials/header.html\u0026quot; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;) (eq .Type \u0026quot;about\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now \u0026ldquo;your title here\u0026rdquo;, which comes from the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.\nUpdate the Default Single Template to Use the Partials $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/","title":"Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll","section":"Blog","content":"Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become\n▾ \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you\u0026rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.\nCreate your Hugo configuration file Hugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the Hugo configuration documentation for details.\nSet your configuration publish folder to _site The default is for Jekyll to publish to _site and for Hugo to publish to public. If, like me, you have _site mapped to a git submodule on the gh-pages branch, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:\n  Change your submodule to point to map gh-pages to public instead of _site (recommended).\n git submodule deinit _site git rm _site git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public    Or, change the Hugo configuration to use _site instead of public.\n { .. \u0026quot;publishdir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;_site\u0026quot;, .. }    Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates That\u0026rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here.

元。大部分的屌丝在第一年做到几万用户的时候就会挂掉，原因众多，最主要要的是意志太弱，受不了最初的寂寞；意志稍微坚强点的会在第二年第三年慢慢挂掉，原因主要是资金断裂、团队分裂；能成功熬到第四年还没饿死、还没被口水淹死、还没被肠胃病颈椎病腰肌劳损折磨死的，甚至员工不减反增的，基本上属于神仙级别了。\n我为什么要说这个小故事呢。首先是因为这是身边每天都在发生的故事，其次是因为感到可惜，IT 界在我眼里一直是一个无比高级的职业，聚集着全球最聪明、最富有的人类精英。以 IT 创业界的青年们的智商，他们可以做成任何一件事情，包括改造银行到制造汽车到发射航天飞机 。结果这帮人却整天在蓬头垢面得为 3k 的月薪而挣扎，太悲催了。\n为什么用悲催这个词？ 如果一个人生下来就在山沟沟里，一辈子都没机会去见什么好东西，这不叫悲催，这只叫苦难；而如果一个人生出来有一个奇怪的特异功能：皮肤出来的汗水会凝结成昂贵的水晶，本来只靠出汗就能赚钱，结果这傻逼居然觉得出汗这个行为太低级，做手术把自己的汗腺全给切了，而且丝毫没有意识到他做了什么傻事，这才叫真的悲催。\n我们 IT 界中的很多人，生下来就是有这个出汗成水晶的特异功能的，正是因为这种与众不同，这群人能混入牛逼的大学，整天打网游还能写出像样的毕业论文， 拿到学位，进外企，考 CPA，做咨询、做证券分析，研究高分子材料，做电子商务，做云计算……一级一级的上升，直到有一天，发现身边的人里，已经没有一个不是 CPA，不是咨询师，不是高级研究员了，身边的人全是业界精英，个个都超级强悍。在这个所谓的高级圈子里，自己并没有任何过人之处，只不过是 just another analyst 而已。在高级圈子里拼的头破血流，最后也只能混到给台湾人整理数据而已。莫然回首，发现当年的血气方刚、年少时的无限梦想，进化成了一身肥胖的赘肉。这个时候，有个旁观者说：“升级到头了，该降级了”\n当一个社会疯狂鼓吹快节奏的时候，一定需要有人来宣扬慢生活；当全社会跟打了鸡血似的吹捧升级的时候，一定需要有人来说说降级论。\nIT 青年们喜欢打游戏，喜欢升级。他们的人生也和游戏一样，沉醉于不停的升级中，不仅喜欢升级自己手上的技术，把 MySql 改成 MongoDB，把 Apache 改为 Nginx，在 Mac 上装 Ubuntu，Ubuntu 里再装个虚拟机去跑 Mac OS……IT 青年们也喜欢升级自己的人生，从程序员升级到项目经理，再升级到技术总监或产品总监，再升级到合伙人……\n在不断追求升级的过程中，所面临的一个很大事实是：当一个人从 A 刚升级到 A+级的时候，其实这个人的能力层级依然只是 A 的层级，还未胜任 A+的层级，他必须要到 A+的后期，才可以胜任 A+。就好像一个高中生，高考完之后，虽然理论上已经属于大学生了，但是他的实际能力依然只是高三毕业的水平，除非他全部 pass 了大一的期末考试。同样的道理，这个世界上有很多人的身份和称谓，都是在描述“未来的自己”，而不是现在的自己。当你从销售员升级为销售经理的时候，你自我感觉很好：“我现在是销售经理了”，但是这个时候 ，你并未通过公司对你作为销售经理这一年的工作成果的考核，你只是一个“未来可能是合格的销售经理”的前身。如果年终考核你失败了，那么这一年最准确的描述是：一个销售员，占了整整一年销售经理的位子，最后失败了。而且这一年一定会过的很累，因为通过考核的其他销售经理，才是真正胜任这个层级的人，跟一帮真正属于这个圈子的人厮杀，就好像拳击馆里当陪练的小角色，去和泰森比了一年的武，怎么可能不累呢？\n当我 07 年进入互联网行业的时候，就是那个拳击馆里陪练的小角色，我被迫去跟全国各地的泰森比拼，结果累的半死。后来我开始反思最初的目标，为什么要在自己身上挂一个“拳击高手”的招牌，被那么多泰森追着打？ 我把这块招牌卸了，找个完全没练武的人去比拼，不是更容易赢么？于是果断照做，去找了一个没人懂拳击的小乡村，做了纯英文的 Tucia.com，只做国外的业务。在那个地方，作为一个知名武馆的拳击小陪练，我成了村子里拳击技术最高超的人，受人仰慕，还开武馆教人拳击，活的非常滋润，而且在教人拳击的过程中，自己的拳术也比以前提高了很多，发展出一套属于自己的拳法，我虽然进不了泰森们的大圈子，但他们也进不了我的小圈子。\n关于圈子，有一个很赤裸裸的现实：不会是你进入圈子，只能是圈子进入你。很多人会四处找关系，“帮我介绍给 xxx 吧，我想进入你们的圈子”，这样的人是永远进不去这个圈子的，因为圈子的天性是，永远追求更高一个层级的人。而我们的大部分人，其实都在以低一级的属性，占着更高一级的位子，徘徊在更高一级的圈子边缘，与更高一级的人竞争，幻想着自己可以升级到那个圈子里去。也许永远进不去，悲催的努力一辈子；也许运气好，某一天真的进入这个圈子了，但那个时候又会有下一个目标，希望进入更高级的圈子，这是一场没有终点的战斗。永远的追求升级，永远的累。\n有没有想过降级呢？\n如果一个来自微软的高级工程师，辞职去一个养猪场做开放平台经理，那么他的到来不仅会让养猪圈感到无比荣幸，更是意味着，利用他在 IT 界训练出来的高效工作方式和逻辑思维能力，他可以掀起一场养猪行业的革命，使得 20 年后才会出现的人性、高效、开放、协作、健康的养殖方式提前到达。在这场革命中，他会活的非常有价值。这种价值，在原先的圈子里，是完全体验不到的，因为他此前的所有工作，只是在满身疮痍的 windows 系统上不停的打补丁，无论打多少都逃不开产品衰落、被人鄙视的命运。\n很多人的命运，都像是上面那个微软工程师。只需要降级，就能创造更大的价值，也能获得更大的满足。那为什么不呢？为什么要死死抱着那个所谓的“高级职业”不放呢？\n去年我曾犯贱去趟了移动互联网的浑水，做了个手机 app，刚开始的时候感觉很高级，但很快，铺天盖地的竞争对手就出现了，我又发现自己陷入了 07 年一样的场景：作为一个小小陪练，我他妈的又被一帮泰森们给围住了。当泰森中的战斗机—微信，变得无比牛逼之后，我就知道，战胜这群泰森是绝对不可能的事情了。于是我再次投靠了“降级论”，把自己从牛逼哄哄的移动互联网行业，降级到了一个被人不齿的低级项目：Tucia Baby。\n这个项目虽然是传统行业，但是我们基本上是按照互联网产品的思路去做的，除了拍摄需要来店里以外，其他一切，包括营销、预约、客服、后期、选片、取片、客户关系等，所有环节都放在网络上（补记：我们的全套 IT 系统已独立成了全新的 DarkRoom 项目）。当然，最重要的是，作为一个脑残的果粉，我按照 iPhone 的做工品质去要求每一张作品，必须达到我们能力可以做到的最好水准，不计成本的最好水准，才允许送给客户。正式接客不到两个月时间，虽然还不敢自称成功，但目前已做到几乎每天都客满，口碑很好，财务上已实现盈利，未来相信一定会比大部分 app 开发者更光明。\n这个项目让我沉思了很久：07 年我曾把一个纯纯的 web2.0 网站做到了 alexa 中国区前 1000 名（如有质疑，请查询 2010 年附近的 tucia.com 排名，那时候还是一个中文网站），结果一路亏损，到最后只剩下一个员工；11 年我把那个纯纯的 app 做到苹果官方推荐区免费榜的第一位（截图），那段时间每天四五千 iPhone 安装量，结果一路烧钱，到最后濒临关闭；而如今，我只需把自己从纯纯的互联网降级下来，做一些看起来有些“低级”的项目，居然就能立即实现收支平衡。\n除此以外，我还发现一个现象，中国消费者在与奸商们的长期斗争中，已经培养出了一种非常苦 B 的品质：只要不被坑，他就谢天谢地。如果商家严格做到了承诺的每一件事情，客户就会感动的泪如泉涌。如果商家不仅做到了所有承诺的事情，还很贴心的提供了一些额外的服务（比如我们给每位客户赠送非常好吃的樱桃和昂贵的进口巧克力作为点心），那么客户就会激动的哭天喊地、奔走相告，推荐给他认识的每一个人。\n其实这片肮脏的国土，就是上天赐予 IT 青年们的最好机会。\n在一个不会练武的村子里，只要你会打两拳，你就是拳术最厉害的人；在一个没有服务意识、忽视产品质量的土地上，只要你用心做服务，用最高的标准去要求自己，你就会成为这块土地上最出色的商家；在一个没有现代管理意识，不懂网络、不懂微博、不懂用户体验、不懂口碑传播的粗犷社会里，你只需要把之前花在 IT 产品上的心思的 10%拿过来用，就可以秒杀一切天朝对手。\n所以，\nIT 青年们，当你在为网站的转化率苦苦思索的时候，当你在为 app 的活跃度辗转反侧的时候，当你在为融资计划苦苦哀求各界大佬引荐的时候，也许犯了一个错误，也许你们的脑子最值得闪光的地方，不是去悲催的 IT 界当炮灰，而应该是去按摩界、餐饮界、烧烤界、早餐界、理发界、送花界、纺织界、装修界、婚庆葬仪界、成人用品界、现代养殖界、有机蔬果界、个人护理界、汽车修理界……与 IT 界相比，这些行业的确无比低级，他们的老板连 qq 都会发音成“抠抠”，他们的员工一辈子都没用过 Email；跟他们解释什么是 SEO，什么是用户体验，什么是数据挖掘，他们会在听你说完之前就开枪自杀掉。正是因为如此，这些行业才是如此的不堪一击。正是因为如此，当智商高达 147 的 IT 青年还在为 3k 薪水拼命、而智商不到 50 的烧烤店老板正坐在 porsche 里玩着前面那位青年开发的 app 的时候，我就忍不住仰望星空。\n这些原始而纯粹的行业，正在等待 IT 精英们的降级，如同蒲公英一般的伞兵，在黑夜里从天而降，长驱直入，用最智慧的产品、最优质的服务拯救这些早就该死的行业，屌丝的生命将会绽放出银色的羽翼，无比丰满，无比性感。\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/posts/selection/","title":"选择的重要性","section":"Blog","content":" State

美国著名心理学专业刊物《心理科学》，在前不久公布了一项很有趣的实验成果：通过改变一个人内心对自身视力的预期，能改变他真实的视力水平。\n普通的视力表是上大下小，于是被测者就有一个心理预期，越往下就会越看不见。而在这项实验中，实验者将视力表的字幕设计为上小下大。被测者的心理预期被扭转过来，越往下，应该看得清楚。\nhttps://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/IIMKg13LHKibretj7loHtP6vBxMiaXsWfOicwnuJl1PIuNGUZmiaM0lsD89DsecKVUPHnvTYheX0QNVUvEBLgHTOqA/640?wx_fmt=jpeg\u0026amp;wxfrom=5\u0026amp;wx_lazy=1\u0026amp;wx_co=1\n实验结果惊人，被测者的视力水平有了大幅提高，在普通视力表中看不清的字母现在也能看清楚了。\n人的心与身之间，意念与躯体之间，存在着奇异而隐秘的联系。\n如果相信它会影响你，它就会；如果你不相信，它就不会。\n倒时钟

年的环境里，听上世纪 50 年代的音乐，看 50 年代的电影和情景喜剧，读 50 年代的报纸和杂志，讨论美国第一次发射人造卫星等 50 年代的国际时事等；他们需要像在 20 年前一样打理生活的一切，从起床、穿衣服到收拾碗筷以及走路。 而另一组，则是在完全相同的饮食作息条件下，用怀旧的方式回忆和谈论 1959 年发生的事。\n 实验的结果是，两组老人的身体素质都有了明显改善。\n而“活”在 20 年前的老人们进步更加惊人，他们手脚更加敏捷，智力测验中得分更高。甚至局外人，在看到他们实验前后的照片，几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。\n生理会引起心里的变化，心念更能导致生理的改变。\n最后

货币、信贷和债务是如何运作的\n理解货币、信贷和债务是如何运作的，这一点至关重要，因为从历史上看，人们最想争取的是财富，现在仍然是如此。而对财富的增加和减少产生最大影响的，就是货币和信贷。\n所以，如果你不理解货币和信贷是如何运作的，你就无法理解经济是如何运作的。如果不理解经济是如何运作的，你就不能理解哪些因素对经济状况有最重要的影响。而经济状况又是政治变化的最大驱动力，也是整个经济政治体系如何运作的最大驱动力。\n01 货币与信用永恒与普世的基本原理 所有实体——国家、公司、非营利组织和人民——都要一直面对同样的基本财务现实。\n 它们有进来的钱(即收入)，也有流出的钱(即支出)，两者相减构成净收入。\n 那些被世界各国广泛接受的钱（即货币）被称为储备货币。目前，世界上占主导地位的储备货币是美元，它是由美国中央银行，也就是美联储创造；它约占所有国际交易的 55%。\n其次是欧元，它是由欧元区国家的央行——欧洲央行创造的；它占所有国际交易的 25%左右。日元、人民币、英镑现在都是相对较小的储备货币，不过人民币的重要性正在快速增长。\n拥有储备货币的国家更容易大量借款(即创造信贷和债务)和创造大量货币 ，因为世界上其他国家会愿意持有这些债务和货币，它们可以用于世界各地的消费。\n对于没有储备货币的国家来说，当它们迫切需要储备货币来偿还以储备货币计价的债务，以及它们在购买东西时卖方希望它们以储备货币支付时，无法获得足够的储备货币来满足这些需求，就会导致他们破产。\n02 什么是金钱？ 1） 大多数货币和信用（尤其是现在存在的法定货币）是没有内在价值的， 2） 它们只是会计系统中的账目，很容易会被改变， 3） 这个系统的目的是帮助有效地分配资源，让生产力得以发展，让借贷双方都能得到回报， 4） 这个系统会定期地崩溃。\n基本面 虽然金钱和信贷与财富有关，但它们不是财富。 一个人不能仅仅通过创造更多的金钱和信贷来创造更多的财富。要创造更多的财富，就必须要有更高的生产力。\n通常情况下，a)货币和信贷的创造与 b)商品、服务和投资资产的生产量之间存在着正相关关系，因此很容易混淆。\n货币和信贷在发放的时候是具有刺激作用的，而在需要偿还的时候则是具有压抑作用的。这就是货币、信贷和经济增长具有周期性的原因。\n控制货币和信贷的人（即中央银行），会通过改变货币和信贷的成本和供应量，以控制市场和整个经济。\n我们可以这样看，央行手中有一瓶刺激剂，他们可以根据需要向经济中注入刺激剂，而瓶中的刺激剂数量是有限的。 当市场和经济下行时，他们注入货币和信贷这种刺激剂来提振市场；当市场过热时，他们会减少刺激剂。 这些动作会导致货币和信贷、商品、服务和金融资产的数量和价格的周期性上涨和下跌。这些动作通常以 *短期债务周期和长期债务周期的形式出现*。\n短期的涨跌周期一般持续 8 年左右，或多或少都会有一次。而时间的长短，是由刺激剂提升需求到实体经济达到生产能力的极限所需要的时间来决定的。它们一般被称为 \u0026ldquo;商业周期\u0026rdquo;，不过我称它们为 \u0026ldquo;短期债务周期\u0026rdquo;，以区别于 \u0026ldquo;长期债务周期\u0026rdquo;。\n在较长的时间里，这些短期债务周期加起来，就变成了通常会持续 50-75 年左右的长期债务周期。\n最近的一个大的长期债务周期，也就是我们现在所处的这个周期，是 1944 年在新罕布什尔州的布雷顿森林设计的，是在 1945 年二战结束，我们开始建立美元/美国主导的世界秩序时，才开始实施的。\n 当央行失去了创造货币和信贷增长从而实现真正的经济增长的能力时，央行的刺激能力就会终结。\n这种情况通常发生在债务水平高企、利率无法合适的降低、货币和信贷的创造使金融资产价格的增长超过实际经济活动增长的时候。\n在这种时候，那些持有债务（也就是别人承诺给他们的货币）的人通常会想把他们所持有的货币债务换成其他的存量财富。\n当人们普遍认为那些货币和债务资产不再是很好的财富贮藏手段时，长期债务周期就走到了尽头，货币体系的结构调整就会发生。\n换句话说，长期债务周期从 1）很低的债务水平和债务负担（这就给了那些控制货币和信贷增长的人足够的能力去创造债务，并且有了债务，就能给借款人创造购买力，持有债务资产的出借人获得良好实际回报的可能性就很大）到 2）很高的债务水平和债务负担，几乎没有空间给借款人创造购买力，出借人获得良好回报的可能性很低。\n到了长期债务周期的末期，瓶子里基本上已经没有刺激剂了（也就是说，央行没有能力再延长债务周期了），所以需要进行债务重组或债务贬值来降低债务负担，让这个周期重新开始。\n 03 长期债务周期 1.无债务或低债务和 \u0026ldquo;硬通货 \u0026quot; 当货币出现在人类社会的早期，人们使用过各种各样的东西当做货币，比如谷物和珠子。但大多数情况下，他们使用的是有内在价值的东西，比如金、银和铜。我们把它叫做 \u0026ldquo;硬通货\u0026rdquo;。\n\u0026ldquo;在所有金融资产中，只有黄金不是别人的负债。\u0026rdquo; 这是因为它具有被广泛接受的内在价值，不像债务资产或其他资产需要有可执行的合同或法律，来确保对方履行交割承诺\n2.对 \u0026ldquo;硬通货\u0026quot;的债权（又称“凭证”或 \u0026ldquo;纸币\u0026rdquo;） 这种货币体系被称为挂钩货币体系，因为货币的价值与某种东西的价值挂钩，这种东西通常是一种 \u0026ldquo;硬通货\u0026rdquo;，比如黄金。\n3. 债务的增加 起初，基于\u0026quot;硬通货\u0026quot;的债权数量，和银行里的\u0026quot;硬通货\u0026quot;一样多。\n这些纸质债权凭证的持有者和银行发现了信用和债权的奥妙。他们可以把这些纸质债权凭证借给银行，这样他们就可以获得利息。\n向他们借钱的银行也乐于这样做，因为他们把钱以更高的利息借给了别人，这样银行也就有了利润。\n在我们举的纸币是 \u0026ldquo;硬通货 \u0026ldquo;债权的例子中，这种 \u0026ldquo;硬通货 \u0026ldquo;的数量也是有限的(例如，作为存款的黄金)。而纸币(对这种硬通货的债权)和债务(对这种纸币的债权)的数量是不断增长的。而且，随着对纸币债权的数量相对于银行所持有的硬通货以及经济中的商品和服务的数量不断增长，这些债务资产的持有者可能无法兑换到他们期望能够兑换到的硬通货或商品和服务数量的风险就会增加。\n要记住，债务周期之所以发生，是因为绝大多数人喜欢扩大购买力（一般是通过债务），而中央银行倾向于扩大货币的数量，因为这样做的时候人们会更高兴。 但这种情况不可能一直持续下去。重要的是要记住，当银行——无论是私有银行还是中央银行——创造了比银行里的硬通货多得多的凭证（纸币和债务）时，终有一天拿来兑换的纸质凭证的数量会超过银行的偿付能力。\n4. 债务危机、违约和货币贬值 历史表明，当社会对银行所持有货币的追索权数量增长速度超过了银行的实际货币数量时，无论银行是私有银行还是政府控制的银行（即中央银行），最终对这一货币追索权的偿付需求都会超过银行能够提供的货币数量，银行就会违约。这就是所谓的 银行挤兑 。\n一家银行如果不能提供足够的硬通货来满足追索权，那么不管是私有银行还是央行，都是有问题的，只不过央行比私人银行有更多的选择。这是因为私有银行不能简单地通过印钞票或改变法律使其更容易偿还债务，而央行可以。\n当私有银行陷入困境时，要么违约，要么被政府救助。而对央行来说，如果债务是以本国货币计价，则可以将其贬值（例如，偿还 50-70%）。如果债务是以他们无法印制的货币计价，那么他们最终也要走向违约。\n5. 法币来了 央行希望拉长货币和信贷周期，使其持续尽可能长的时间，因为这比其他办法要好得多。所以，当 \u0026ldquo;硬通货\u0026quot;和\u0026quot;对硬通货的追索权\u0026quot;成为他们的严重束缚时，政府通常会放弃它们，转而采用所谓的 \u0026ldquo;法定\u0026quot;货币。\n历史已经告诉我们， 我们不应该依赖政府在经济上保护我们。相反，我们应该知道，大多数政府会滥用他们作为货币和信贷的创造者和使用者的特权地位。 假设你站在他们的立场上，你可能会做出一样的举动。\n因为在债务周期的早期，政府是值得信赖的，他们和其他人一样需要钱，甚至比其他人更需要钱，所以他们通常是最大的借款人。而在周期的后期，当后续领导人上台执掌政府时，会面临更多债务。这时新的政府领导人和新的央行决策者们就要面对更大的挑战，此时一方面他们的刺激手段较少，同时还要必须偿还债务。\n当政府出现债务问题时，他们会如何应对？\n他们会和任何一个实际债务负担沉重的实体一样，用印钞来解决。无一例外，如果债务是以自己的货币计价，他们就会印钱让货币贬值。\n通过印钱买债（称为 债务货币化 ）的方式，作为一种 获取金钱和将财富从拥有金钱的人手中转移到需要金钱的人手中的方式 ，比起征税导致纳税人不满，在政治上要好得多。这就是为什么央行总是印钞票、让货币贬值的原因。\n当政府印了很多钱，买了很多债，这样钱和债的数量都增加了，钱和债的价格就会便宜，这实质上是向拥有这些钱和债的人征税。\n在长期债务周期较早的时候，当未偿债务数额不大，有很大的空间通过降息来刺激（如果不降息，就印钱和买入金融资产），那么信贷增长和经济增长的可能性就越大。\n而在长期债务周期较晚的时候，当债务数额较大，没有太多空间通过降息（或印钱和买入金融资产）来刺激，那么伴随着经济疲软而出现货币通胀的可能性就越大。\n6. 重回硬通货 过度印制法币会导致债务资产的抛售，以及之前描述的类似银行\u0026quot;挤兑\u0026quot;的情况，最终会降低货币和信贷的价值，促使人们逃离货币和债务（如债券）。他们也就需要决定将使用何种替代性的财富存储方式。\n历史经验告诉我们，他们通常会转向黄金、其他货币、其他国家没有这些问题的资产，以及能够保留其实际价值的股票。\n货币自身价值的减弱，会导致货币贬值，人们也会抛弃这种货币，并将资产投入其他地方。历史上，当货币贬值的时候，人们会奔向大量其他东西，甚至包括德国魏玛共和国的石头（用于建筑）。\n那些拥有财富的人想要转移到硬资产和其他货币和其他国家。很自然的，国家会阻止这种外逃。所以，在这种时候，政府就会加大对黄金（例如，通过取缔黄金的交易和所有权）、外国货币（通过取消其交易能力）、外国资产（通过建立外汇管制来防止资金流出国境）的投资难度。\n最终，债务基本上被消灭，通常是 通过让还债的钱既多又便宜，使货币和债务都贬值。\n当这种情况变得极端，以至于货币和信贷体系崩溃，债务贬值和/或违约出现时，政府通常不得不回到某种形式的硬通货，以重建人们对货币作为财富存储的价值的信心，从而恢复信贷增长。\n很多时候，尽管并非总是如此，但政府往往会将其货币与某种硬通货（如黄金或硬储备货币）挂钩，并承诺允许新货币的持有者将其兑换成硬通货。\n04 长期债务周期总结 几千年来，货币制度一直有三种类型：\n 硬通货（如金属硬币） 以“纸币”形式存在的对硬通货的的追索权 法定货币（如今天的美元）  硬通货是最具限制性的货币体系，因为除非增加金属或其他具有内在价值的商品（即货币）的供应量，否则就无法创造货币。\n第二种类型更容易创造货币和信贷，因此硬通货债权与实际持有的硬通货之间的比率上升，最终导致银行挤兑。结果有二：\n 一是违约，银行关门且储户失去硬资产； 二是有可能跟前者一起发生的债权货币贬值，这意味着储户拿回来的钱变少了。  而在第三种类型中，政府可以自由地创造货币和信贷。只要人们对货币有信心，这种做法就持续有效，反之则无效。\n纵观历史，各国在这些不同类型的制度之间过渡，都有合乎逻辑的原因。当一个国家需要的货币和信贷比现有数量更多时，无论是出于应对债务、战争还是其他原因，它自然会从第一种类型过渡到第二种类型，或从第二种类型过渡到第三种类型，这样它就有了更多的印钞灵活性。此后，过多的货币供应和债务带来了货币贬值，致使人们不再持有债务和货币作为财富储备，转而回流到硬资产（如黄金）和其他货币中。鉴于这种情况一般发生在产生财富冲突或战争时期，人们通常也会想逃离此地。这类国家需要重新建立起以货币作为财富储备的信心，才能恢复信贷市场。\n05 拥有储备货币的力量 储备货币是一种在世界范围内被广泛用作交换媒介和财富储备的货币。\n世界新秩序始于1945年第二十次世界大战结束之后，而布雷顿森林协定在1944年确立了美元作为世界主要储备货币的地位。\n当时，个人持有黄金属于非法，其原因在于政府领导人不想让黄金作为财富储备来与货币和信贷竞争。所以，在那个时候，黄金就是银行里的钱，而纸币就像支票簿里的支票一样，可以兑换成真金白银。在这个全新货币体系建立的时候，美国政府每持有一盎司黄金就拥有 50 美元的纸币，所以几乎 100%有黄金做后盾。\n在此后的几年里，为了给自己的活动提供资金，美国政府的支出超过了税收收入，因此不得不借钱，从而产生了更多以美元计价的债务。美联储所允许建立的黄金债权数量（如美元计价的货币和信贷），远远超过了能以 35 美元价格兑换成的黄金实际数量。\n在纸币被兑换成硬通货（黄金）之后，美国银行之中的黄金数量随之下降，黄金债权则继续上升。其结果就是，在 1971 年 8 月 15 日，布雷顿森林货币体系崩溃了。 当时，时任美国总统尼克松和 1933 年 3 月 5 日的罗斯福一样，未能履行当局承诺，即允许美元持有者将其兑换成黄金。于是，美元对黄金和和其他货币贬值。 这时，美国和所有国家都进入了第三种类型，法币体系。\n这种向法币体系的转变使美联储和其他中央银行得以创造大量以美元计价的货币和信贷，从而导致了 1970 年代的通货膨胀，其特点是从美元和美元债逃向商品、服务以及黄金等可以对冲通胀的资产。\n这种对美元债的恐慌情绪还导致了利率走高，并将金价从 1944 年至 1971 年期间固定的 35 美元推至当时的历史高位——1980 年的 670 美元。\n20 世纪 70 年代，货币和信贷主要通过上述方式管理。这时，借入美元并将其转换为商品和服务是有利可图的，所以许多国家的许多实体都大量通过美国银行借入美元。 结果，以美元计价的债务在全球范围内迅速增长，而美国银行通过把美元放给借款人来赚了很多钱。 这种贷款导致了债务周期中经典的债务泡沫。恐慌情绪让人逃离美元和美元债资产并转向通胀对冲资产，快速借入美元和背负债务的速度也在加快。这就造成了 1979-1982 年期间的货币和信贷危机。 在那期间， =美元和美元债面临着不再担任公认财富储备的风险=。\n美联储通过向美国银行提供所需的资金来保护他们，而美国的会计制度则不要求银行将这些坏账作为损失来核算，或无需按照实际价格来对这些债务资产进行估值，从而保护美国银行免于破产。\n它导致了 70 年代的通胀和通胀对冲资产的飙升，随后又带来 1979-1981 年的紧缩、非美债务人大量的通缩债务重组、通胀率下降，以及 1980 年代债券和其他通缩资产的出色表现。这整个时期都有力地证明了拥有世界储备货币的美国具有怎样的力量，以及储备货币管理方式对世界各国的影响。从 1979-1981 年期间以美元计价的通货膨胀率和利率双双达到峰值到现在，通胀和利率都降到了接近 0%。\n20 世纪 80 年代债务重组完成后，全球货币、信贷和债务的全新增长又在 90 年代开始了。这再次带来了经济繁荣，并且导致投资者举债进行投机性投资，最终形成在 2000 年破裂的科网泡沫。\n泡沫的破裂引出了 2000-2001 年的经济衰退，并刺激美联储放宽货币和信贷，将债务水平推到了新的高点。接下来，又一次的经济繁荣到来，另一个更大的债务泡沫在 2007 年诞生，于 2008 年破裂。\n于是美联储和其他储备货币国家的央行再次宽松，又带来了近期刚刚破裂的下一个泡沫。然而，这一次创造应对经济衰退所需货币和信贷的方式却被设计得十分不同。\n短期利率在 2008 年达到 0%，而这个降息的幅度尚无法满足货币和信贷扩张的需要。通过降息刺激货币和信贷增长是央行的首选货币政策。我称其为\u0026quot;货币政策 1\u0026rdquo;。随着这种方法不再适用于中央银行，他们就转向了 第二选择（我称之为\u0026quot;货币政策 2\u0026rdquo;），即印钞和购买以国债、优质债务为主的金融资产。\n通过购买债券，央行推高了债券价格，并为这些债券的卖家提供现金，致使他们去购买其他资产。这就推高了其他资产的价格，而随着这些资产价格上涨，未来的预期回报率随之下降。\n由于利率低于其他投资的预期回报率，而相对于投资者为其各种支出义务提供资金所需的回报率而言，债券收益率和其他未来预期回报率的水平都很低，因此，投资者越来越频繁地借钱购买他们认为收益将高于借贷成本的资产。 这既推高了上述资产的价格，又造成了新的债务泡沫脆弱性——如果他们所购资产收益低于其借贷成本，就会产生新的债务泡沫。\n由于长期和短期利率都在 0%左右，而且央行购买债券的资金无法刺激经济增长和帮助那些最需要帮助的人，所以我觉得第二种货币政策显然不能很好地发挥作用，这就需要第三种货币政策——\u0026ldquo;货币政策 3\u0026rdquo;。\n“货币政策 3”的工作原理是， 储备货币中央政府增加借贷，并将其支出和贷款的目标定在他们想要的地方，而储备货币中央银行则创造货币和信贷，并购买债务（可能还有其他资产，如股票）来提供资金。\n在 1944 年，当美元被选定为全球主要储备货币时，美国政府持有的黄金占全球黄金总量的约三分之二（黄金当时被视为货币），美国经济则约占全球 GDP 的一半。 如今，美国 GDP 只占全球的 20%左右，但美元仍占全球外汇储备的 60%左右，还占有国际交易量的半壁江山。所以，美元和以美元为基础的货币和支付体系仍然占据着至高无上的地位，相对于美国经济的规模而言，它的规模还是特大号。\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/posts/du-shu-yu-huan-jing/","title":"读书与环境","section":"Blog","content":"多读一年书到底能带来多少收入？

公开市场操作是中央银行吞吐基础货币，调节市场流动性的主要货币政策工具，通过中央银行与市场交易对手进行有价证券和外汇交易，实现货币政策调控目标。\n中国公开市场操作包括人民币操作和外汇操作两部分。\n从交易品种看，中国人民银行公开市场业务债券交易主要包括回购交易、现券交易和发行中央银行票据。\n回购交易   正回购 为中国人民银行向一级交易商卖出有价证券，并约定在未来购回的行为。央行进行正回购操作为回收流动性，正回购到期则为投放流动性。\n  逆回购 为中国人民银行向一级交易商购买有价证券，并约定在未来由一级交易商购回的行为。央行进行逆回购操作为投放流动性，逆回购到期则为回收流动性。\n  现券交易   现券买断 央行直接从二级市场买入债券，一次性地投放基础货币；\n  现券卖断 为央行直接卖出持有债券，一次性地回笼基础货币。\n  中央银行票据 即中国人民银行发行的短期债券，央行通过发行央行票据可以回笼基础货币，央行票据到期则体现为投放基础货币。\nnote OMO、MLF 和 LPR 是央行针对不同期限和不同目标的利率调整工具。\n理论上来看，OMO、MLF 以及 LPR 三者变化实现不同的政策效果，并且调整利率曲线变化，因而三者不一定需要同时变化.\nMLF 中期借贷便利 （Medium-term Lending Facility） feature  央行借钱给商业银行(有门槛的，就是质押品) 操作时段一般为 3 个月、6个月、1年。  function  为了增加市场流动性  LPR 贷款市场报价利率 (Loan Prime Rate) k LPR 浮动利率是由 LPR 市场报价利率加基点构成的，基点数是固定的.\n常识  贷款市场报价利率 ，也叫 贷款基础利率 ，由 18 家银行共同报价计算得来的，央行用它来代替原有的贷款基准利率。 利率分为 1 年期和 5 年期以上，房贷是和 5 年期以上的利率挂钩的。是在 5 年期的 LPR 基础上加基点上浮而来的。 LPR 每个月 20 日（遇节假日顺延）会更新一次 房贷不会跟随 LPR 每月更新。  SLF 常备借贷便利 主要功能是满足金融机构期限较长的大额流动性需求，在银行体系流动性出现临时性波动时相机运用。\n 面对的是政策性银行和全国性商业银行 期限为 1-3 个月 利率水平则根据货币政策调控、引导市场利率的需要等因素综合确定。  SLO 短期流动性调节工具。  每周二、周四，央行一般都会进行公开市场操作，目前最主要的是回购操作。 主要以期限在 7 天以内的正回购和逆回购为主 央行可以通过 SLO 来调节 7 天以内的超短期货币供应和利率，遇节假日可适当延长操作期限 采用市场化利率招标方式开展操作。  PSL 全称为抵押补充贷款工具  多是央行为了支持一些特定项目的建设向政策性银行(如国开行)提供的成本较低的抵押贷款，期限一般在 3-5 年; 它还可以用于向市场投放货币，调节中期市场利率。  基点 bp 是指基点 Basis Point（bp）\n基点的定义是“百分之零点零一”（0.01%）\n金融方面，债券和票据利率改变量的度量单位。一个基点等于 0.01 个百分点，即 0.01%，因此，100 个基点等于 1%。\n逆回购 逆回购从本质上讲是一种短期贷款，就是你把钱借给别人，获得固定利息；别人用债券（国债或企业债）作抵押，到期还本付息。\n上海市场国债逆回购：交易数量为 10 万或 10 万的整数倍；\n深圳市场债券逆回购：交易数量为 1000 元或其整数倍；\n  净收益 净收益 = 成交金额×年收益率×资金实际占用天数/365 天 - 手续费\n比活期存款利息高.\n通货膨胀 三个主要的催化剂：\n 需求拉动型通货膨胀 指一个经济体对商品和服务的总体需求增长速度快于该经济体的生产能力的增长速度供需 需求增加而供给减少，从而导致价格上涨。 成本拉动型通货膨胀 内在通货膨胀 随着商品和服务价格的上涨，劳动力期望并要求更高的工资来维持他们的生活成本。  通货紧缩 指货币供应量少于流通领域对货币的实际需求量而引起的货币升值，从而引起的商品和劳务的货币价格总水平持续下跌的现象。(简单来说就是钱变得更值钱了)\n通货膨胀 VS 通货紧缩 货币具有“通货”的性质。.\n央行增加货币供应量本质是增加社会总产出，而不是让钞票更值钱。\n通货紧缩时，持有现金本身就是对自己的投资。\n适度的通货膨胀是一个正常的经济现象，而通货紧缩会阻碍经济的正常运行，比通货膨胀更加可怕！\n滞胀 通货膨胀、经济增长缓慢或停滞、失业率相对较高的经济.\n滞胀的原因各不相同，但主要是由于严厉的监管和货币供应量的增加。\n货币乘数 货币乘数是指货币供给量对基础货币的倍数关系，简单地说，货币乘数是一单位准备金所产生的货币量。\n对于不同时期的货币乘数大概率是不一样的，总体而言随时间上涨和上涨，但是会有一个上限，而且这个上限肯定是小于 法定准备金的倒数 的，也就是基础货币最终不可能全部回到央行的(因为货币可能会损坏，银行为了控制风险一定会留存一部分现金，公众也会预留一部分进行日常使用)。\n信贷, M2 和社融  货币政策、信贷、M2与社融\n信贷 在二级银行制度下，央行只“印”了基础货币，而广义货币是银行通过信贷投放来派生的。央行又规定了存款准备金率，从而限定的银行派生 M2 的能力。\nM2    M define     M0（货币） 流通中的现金，即流通于银行体系之外的现金   M1（狭义货币） M0 + 企业活期存款   M2（广义货币） M1 + 准货币（居民储蓄款 + 定期存款 + 其他存款

M0、M1、M2 的流动性是逐级递减的\n而 M2 是商业银行资产负债表的右侧，是负债端。\n  社融 社融是金融机构资产负债表的左侧，是资产端\nM2 和社融通常是投资的领先指标，M2 增速减去名义 GDP

忙处事为，常向闲中先检点，过举自稀。动时念想，预从静里密持，非心自息。 为善欲自高月胜人，施恩而欲要名结好，修业而欲惊世通话骇俗，植节而欲标 异见奇，此皆是善念中戈矛，理路上荆棘，最易夹带，最难拔除者也。须是涤尽渣滓，斩绝萌芽，才见本来真体。 能轻富贵，不能轻一轻富贵之心；能重义，又复重一重名义之念。是事境之芥蒂未扫。此处拔除不净，恐石去而复生矣。 纷扰固溺志之场，而枯寂亦心之地。故学者当栖心元默，以宁吾真体。亦当适志恬愉，以养吾圆机。 昨日之日不可留，留之则根烬复萌，而尘情终累乎理趣；今日之是不可执，执这则渣滓未化，而理趣反转为欲根。 无事便思有闲杂念想否。有事便思有浮意气否。得意便思有骄矜辞色否。失意便思有怨望情怀否。时时检点，到得从多入少、从有入无，才是学问的真消息。 士人有百折不回之 真心，才有万变不穷之妙用。立业建功，事事要从实地着脚，若少慕声，便成伪果；讲道修德，念念要从虚处立基，若稍计功效，便落尘情。 身不宜忙，而忙于闲暇之时，亦可儆惕惰气；心不可放，而放于收摄之后，亦可鼓畅天机。 钟鼓体虚，为声闻而招撞；麋鹿性逸，因豢养而受羁縻。可见名为招祸之本，欲乃散志之媒。学者不可不力为扫除也。 一念常惺，才避去神弓鬼矢；纤尘不染；方解开地网天罗。 一点不能说忍的念头，是生民生物之根芽；一段不为的气节，是撑地之柱石。故君子于一虫一蚁不忍伤残，一缕地丝勿容贪冒，便可为万物立命立心矣。 拨开世上尘氛，胸中自无火焰冰竞；消却心中鄙吝。眼前时有月到风来。 学者动静殊操、喧寂异趣，还是锻炼未熟，心神混淆故耳。须是操存涵养，定云止水中，有鸢飞鱼跃的景象；风狂雨骤处，有波恬浪静的风光，才见处一化齐之妙。 心是一颗明珠。以物欲障蔽之，犹明珠而混以泥沙，其洗涤犹易；以情识衬贴之，犹明珠而饰以银黄，其洗涤最难。故学者不患垢病，而洁病治；不畏事障，而畏理障之 难除。 躯壳的我要看得破，则万有空而其心常虚，虚则义理来居；性命和我要兴得真，则万理皆备而其心常实，实则物欲不入。 面上扫开十层甲，眉目才无可憎；胸中涤去数斗尘，语言方觉有味。 完得心是之本来，方可言了心；尽得世间之常道，才堪论岀世。 我果为洪炉大冶，何患顽金钝铁之不可陶熔。我果为巨海长江，何患横流污渎之不能容纳。 白日欺人，难逃清夜之鬼报；红颜失志，空贻皓首之悲伤。 以积货财之心积学问，以求功名之念求道德，以爱妻子之心爱父母，以保爵位之策保国家，岀此入彼，念虑只差毫末，而超凡入圣，人品且判星渊矣。人胡不猛然转念哉！ 立百福之基，只在一念慈祥，开万善之门，无如寸心挹损。 塞得物欲之路，才堪辟道义之门；弛得尘俗之肩，方可挑圣贤之担。 容得性情上偏私，便是一大学问；消得家庭内嫌雪，才为火内栽莲。 事理因人言而悟者，有悟还有迷，总不如自悟之了了；意兴从外境而得者，有得还有失，总不旭自处之休休。 情之同处即为性，舍情则性不可见，欲之公处即为理，舍欲则理不可明。故君子不能灭情，惟事平情而已；不能绝欲，惟期寡欲而已。 欲遇变而无仓忙，须向常时念念守得定；欲临死而无贪恋，段仙生时事事看得轻。一念过差，足丧生平之善；终身检饬，难盖一事之愆。 从五更枕席上参勘心体，气未动，情未萌，才见本来面目；向三时饮食中谙练世味，浓不欣，淡不厌，方为切实工夫。  应酬  操存要有真宰，无真宰则遇事便倒，何以植顶天立地之砥柱！应用要有圆机，无机则触物有碍，何以成旋乾转坤之经纶！ 士君子之涉世，于人不可轻为喜怒，喜怒轻，则心腹肝胆皆为人所窥；于物不可重为爱憎，爱憎重，则意气精神悉为物所制。 倚高才而玩世，背后须防影之虫；饰厚貌以欺人，面前恐有照之镜。 心体澄彻，常在明镜止水之中，则天下自无可厌之事；意气和平，常在丽日风之内，则天下自无可恶之人。当是非邪正之交，不可少迁就，少迁就则失从违之 正；值利害得失之 会，不可太分明，太分明则起避之私。 苍蝇附骥，捷则捷矣，难辞处后之羞；萝茑依松，高则高矣，未免仰攀之耻。所以君子宁以风霜自挟，毋为鱼鸟亲人。 好丑心太明，收物不分契；贤愚心太明，则人不亲。士君子从而是内精明而外浑厚，使好丑两得其平，贤愚共受其益，才是生的德量。 伺察以为明者，常因明南昌生暗，故君子以恬养智；奋迅以为速者，多因速度南昌致迟，故君子以重持轻。士君子 济人利物，宜居其名，居其名则德损；士大夫忧国为人，当有其心，不当有其语，有其语则毁来。 遇大事矜持者，小事必纵弛；处明庭检饰者，暗室必放逸。君子只是一个念头持到底，自然临小事如临大敌，坐密室若坐通衢。 使人有面前之誉，不若使其无背后之毁；使人有乍交之欢，不若使其无久处之厌。 善启迪人心者，当因其所而渐通之，毌强开其所闭；善移风化者，当因其所易而渐及之，毌轻矫其所难。 彩笔描空，笔不落色，而空亦不受染；利刀割水，刀不损锷，而水亦不留痕。得此意以持身涉世，感与应俱适，心与境两忘矣。 已之情欲不可纵，当用逆之之法以制之，其道只在一忍字；人之情欲不可拂，当用顺之之法以调之，其道只在一恕字。今人皆恕以适已而忍以制人，毌乃不可乎！ 好察非明，能察能不察之谓明；必胜非勇，能胜不胜之谓勇。 随时之内善救时，若和风之消酷暑；混俗之中能脱垢浊之尘缘；思岀世而无染者，段先谙尽世中滋味。否则无以持空寂之后苦趣。 与人者，与其易疏于终，不若难亲于始；御事者，与其巧持于后，不若拙守于前。 酷烈之祸，多起于玩之人；盛满炎功，常败于细微炎事。故语去：“人人道好，段防一人着脑；事事有功，采购防一事不终。” 功名富贵，直从灭处观究竟，则贪恋自轻；横逆困穷，直从起处究由来，则怨尤自息。 宇宙内事要力担当，又要善摆脱。不担当，则无经世之事业；不摆脱，则列出世之襟期。 待人而留有余，不尽之恩礼，则可以维系无厌之人心；御事而留有余，不尽之才智，则可以提防不测之事变。 了心自了事，犹根拔而草不生；逃世不逃名，似膻存蚋而仍集。 仇边之弩易避，而恩里之戈难防；苦 时之坎易逃，而乐处之阱难脱。 膻秽则蝇蚋丛嘬，芳磬则蜂蝶交侵。故君子不作垢业，亦不立芳名。只是元气浑然，圭角不露，便是持身涉世一安乐窝也。 从静中观物动，向闲处看人忙，才得超尘脱俗的趣味；遇忙处会偷闲，处闹中能取静，便是安身立命的工夫。 邀千百之欢，不如释一人之怨；希千百事之荣，不如免一事之丑。 落落者，难合亦难分；欣欣者，易亲亦易散。是以君子宁以刚方见惮，毌以媚悦取容。 意气与天下相期，如春风之鼓畅庶类，不宜存半点隔之形；肝胆与天下相照，似秋月之洞彻群品，不可作一毫暧昧之状。 仕途虽赫奕，常思林下的风味，则权且之念自轻；世途虽纷华，常思泉下的光景，则利欲之心自淡。鸿示至先援弓，兔已亡再呼，总非当机作用国风息时休起浪，岸到处便离船，才是了手工夫。 从热闹场中出几句清冷言语，便扫除无限杀机；向寒微路上用一点赤热心肠，自培植许多生意。随缘便是遣缘，似舞蝶与飞花共适；顺事自然无事，若满月偕盂水同圆。 淡泊之守，须从浓艳场中试来；镇定之操，还向纷纭境上勘过。不然操持未定，应用未圆，恐一临机登坛，而上品禅师又成一下品俗士矣。 廉所以戒贪。我果不贪，又何必标一廉名，以来贪夫之侧目。让所以戒争，又何必立一让的，以致暴客之弯弓。 无事常如有事时，提防才可以弥意外之变；有事常如无事时，镇定方可以消局中之危。 处世而欲人感恩，便为敛怨之道；遇事而为人除害，即是导利之机。 持身如泰山九鼎凝然不动，则愆尤自少；应吉若流水落花悠然而逝，则趣味常多。 君子严如介石南昌畏其难亲。鲜不以明珠为怪物而起胺剑之心；小人骨如脂南昌喜其易合，鲜不以互毒螫为甘饴而纵染指之欲。 遇事只一味镇定从容，纵纷若乱丝，终当就绪；待人无半毫矫伪欺隐，虽狡如鬼，亦自献诚。 肝肠煦若春风，虽囊无一文，还怜茕独；气骨清如秋水，纵家徒四壁，终傲王公。 讨了人事的便宜，必受天道的亏；贪发世味胡滋益，必招性分胡损。涉世者宜蕃择之，慎毌贪黄雀南昌坠深井，舍隋珠南昌弹飞禽也。费千金而结纳贤豪，熟若倾半瓢之粟，以济饥饿之人；构千楹而招来宾客，孰若葺数椽之茅，以庇孤寒之士。 解斗者助之以威，则怒气自平；惩贪者济之以欲，则利心反淡。所谓因其势而利导之，亦救时应变一权宜法也。 市恩不如报德之为。雪忿不若忍耻不高。要誉不如逃名之不适。矫情不若直节之为真。 救既败事者，如驭临之马，休轻策一鞭；图垂成之功者，如挽上滩之舟，莫少停一棹。/ 先达笑弹冠，休向侯门轻曳裾；相知犹按剑，莫从世路暗投珠。 杨修之躯见杀于曹操，以露已之长也；韦诞之墓见伐于钟繇，以秘已之美也。故哲士多匿采以韬光，至人常逊美而公善。 少年的人，不患其不奋迅，常患畚迅而成卤莽，故当抑其躁心；老成的人，不患其不持重，常患以持重而成退缩，故当振其惰气。 望重缙绅，怎似寒微之颂德。朋来海宇，何如骨肉之孚心。 舌存常见齿亡，刚强终不胜柔弱；户朽未闻枢蠹，偏执岂能及圆融。  评议  物莫大于天地日月，而子美云：“日月笼中鸟，亁坤水上萍。”莫事大于揖逊征诛，而康节云：“唐虞揖逊三杯酒，汤武征诛一局棋。”人能以此胸襟眼界吞吐六合，上下千古，事来如沤生大海，事去如影灭长空，自经纶万变而不动一尘矣。 君子好名，便起欺人之念；小人好名，犹怀畏人之心。故人而皆好名，则开诈善之门。使人而不好名，则绝为善之路。此讥好名者，当严责君子，不当过求于小人也。 大恶多从柔处伏，哲士须防绵里之针；深仇常自爱中来，达人宜远刀头之蜜。 持身涉世，不可随境而迁。须是大火流金而清风穆然，严霜杀物而和气蔼然，阴霾翳空而慧日朗然，洪涛倒海而坻柱屹我，方是宇宙内的真人品。爱是万缘之根，当知割舍。识是众欲之本，要力扫除。 作人要脱俗，不可存一矫俗这心；应世要随时，不可起一趋时之念。 宁有求全之毁，不可有过情之誉；宁有无妄之灾，不可有非分之福。 毁人者不美，而受人毁者遭一番讪谤便加一番修省，可释回而增美；欺人者非福，而受人欺者遇一番横逆一番器宇，可以转祸而为福。 梦里悬金佩玉，事事逼真，睡去虽真觉后假；闲中演偈谈元，言言酷似，说来虽是用时非。 天欲祸人，必先以微福骄之，所以福来不必喜，要看他会受；天欲福人，必先以微祸儆之，所以祸来不必忧，要看他会救。 荣与辱共蒂，厌辱何须求荣；生与死同根，贪生不必畏死。 作人只是一味率真，踪迹虽隐还显；存心若有半毫未净，事为虽公亦私。 鹩占一枝，反笑鹏心奢侈；兔营三窟，转嗤鹤垒高危。智小者不可以谋大，趣卑者不可与谈高。信然矣！ 贫贱骄人，虽涉虚骄，还有几分侠气，英雄欺世，纵似挥霍，钱没半点真心。糟糠不为彘肥，我何事偏贪钩下饵；锦绮岂因牺贵，谁人能解笼中囵囮。 琴书诗画，达士以之养性灵，而庸夫徒赏其迹象；山川云物，高人以之助学识，而俗子徒玩其光华，可见事物无定品，随人识见以为商下。故读书穷理，要以识趣为先。 姜女不尚华，似疏梅之映淡月；禅师不落空寂，若碧沼之吐青莲。 廉官多无后，以其太清也，痴人每多福，以鞭近厚也。故君子虽重廉洁，不可无含垢纳污之雅量。虽戒痴顽，亦不必有察渊洗垢之精明。 密则神气拘逼，疏则城真烂漫，此岂独诗文之工拙从此分哉！吾见周密之人纯用机巧，疏狂之士独任性真，人心之生死亦于此判也。 翠筱傲严霜，节 1 纵商，无伤冲雅；红蕖媚秋水，色虽艳丽，何禹清修。 簪缨之士，常不及孤寒之子可以抗节致忠，庙堂之士常不及山野之夫可以料事烛理。何也？彼以浓艳损志，此以淡泊全真也。 荣宠旁边辱等待，不必扬扬；困穷背后福跟随，何段戚戚。 古人闲适处，今人却忙过了一生，古人实受处，今人又虚度了一世。总是耽空逐妄，看全色身不破，认个法身不真耳。 芝草无根醴无源，志士当勇奋翼；彩云易散琉璃脆，达人当早回头。 少壮者，事事当用意而意反轻，徒汛汛作水中凫而已，何以振云霄之翮？衰老者，事事宜忘情而情反重，徒碌碌为辕下驹而已，何以脱缰锁之身？ 帆只扬五公，船便安。水只注五分，器便稳。如韩信以勇震主被擒，陆机以才名冠世见杀，霍光败于权势逼君，石崇死于财赋敌国，皆以十公取败者刀。康节云：“饮酒莫教成酩酊，看花慎勿至离披。”旨哉言乎 附势者如寄生依木，木伐而寄生亦枯；窃利者如蝇虰盗人，人死而蝇虰亦灭。始以势利害人，终以势利自毙。势利炎不害也，如是夫！ 失血于杯中，堪笑猩猩之嗜酒，为巢于幕上，可怜燕燕之偷安。 鹤立鸡群，可谓超然无侣矣。然进而观于大海之鹏。则眇然自小。又进而求之九霄之凤，则巍乎莫及。所以至人常若无若虚，而盛德多不柔不伐也，贪心胜者，逐兽而不见泰山在前，弹雀而不知深井在后；疑心胜者，见弓影而惊杯中之蛇，听人立而信市上之虎。人心一偏，遂视有为无，造无作有。如此，心可妄动哉！ 蛾扑火，火焦蛾，叵谓祸生无本；果种花，花结果，须知福至有因。 车争险道，马骋先鞭，到败处未免噬脐；粟喜堆山，几朝霜，几朝雪，傲就琅玕。 富贵是无情之物，看得他重，他害你越大，贫贱是耐久之交，处得他好，他益你深，故贪商旅而恋金谷乾，竟被一时之显戮，乐箪瓢而甘敝缊者，张洋享千载之令名。 鸽恶铃而商飞，不知敛翼而铃自息；人恶影而疾走，不知处阴而影自灭。故愚夫徒走高飞，而平地反为苦海，达士知处阴敛翼，而〇岩亦是坦途。秋虫春鸟共畅天机，何必浪生悲喜，老树新花同含生意，胡为妄别媸妍。 多栽桃李少栽荆，便是开条福路，不积诗书偏积玉，还如筑个祸基。 万境一辙原无地，着个穷通，万物一体原无处，分个彼我，世人迷真逐妄，乃向坦途上自没一坷坎，从空洞中自筑一藩蓠，享受足慨哉！ 大聪明的人，小事必朦胧，大懵懂的人，小事必伺察。盖伺察乃懵懂之根，而朦胧正聪明之窟也。 大烈鸿猷，常出悠闲镇定之士，不必忙忙，休征景福，多集宽洪长厚之家，何须琐琐。 贫士肯济人，才是性天中惠泽，闹场能学道，方为心地上工夫。 人生只为欲字所累，便如马如牛，听人羁络；为鹰为犬，任物鞭笞。若果一念清明，淡然无欲，天地也不能转动我，鬼神也不能役使我，况一切区区事物乎! 贫得者身富而尽贫，知足者身贫而心富；居高者形逸而神劳，处下者形劳而神逸。孰得孰失，孰幻孰真，达人当自辨之。 谢豹覆面，犹知自愧，，唐鼠易肠，犹知自悔。美国 愧悔二字，乃吾人去恶迁善之门，起死回生之路也，人生无此念头，便是既死之寒灰，已枯之槁木矣。何处讨些生理？ 异宝厅琛，俱民必争之器，瑰节奇行，多冒不祥之名，总为若寻常历履简行藏，可以完天地浑噩之真，享民物各平之福。 福善不在杳冥，即在食息起居处牖其衷；祸淫不在幽渺，即在动静语默间夺其魄。可见人之精爽通于天，于之威命即寓于人，天人岂相远哉！  闲适  昼闲人寂，听数声鸟语悠扬，不觉耳根尽彻；夜静天高，看一片云光舒巻，顿令眼界俱空。 世事如棋局，不着得才是高手，人生似瓦盆，打破了方见真空。 龙可豢非真龙，虎可搏非真虎，故爵禄可饵荣进之辈，必不可笼淡无欲之人；鼎镬可及宠利之流，必不可加飘然远引之士。 一场闲富贵，狠狠争来，虽得还不失，百岁好光阴，忙忙过了，纵寿亦为夭。 高车嫌地僻，不如钱鸟解亲人，驷马喜门高。怎似莺花能避俗。 红烛烧残，万念自然厌冷，黄梁梦破，一身亦似云浮。 千载厅逢，无如好书良友，一生清福，只在碗茗炉烟。 蓬茅下育诗读书，日日与圣贤晤晤，谁云贫是病？樽垒边幕天席地，时时共造化氤氲，孰谓非禅？兴来醉倒落花前，天地即为衾枕。机息坐忘盘上，古今尽属蜉蝣。 昴藏老鹤虽饥，饮啄犹闲，肯同鸡鹜之营营而竞食？偃蹇寒松纵老，丰标自在，岂似桃李之灼灼而争妍！ 吾人适志于花柳烂漫之量，得趣于笙歌腾沸之处，乃是造化之幻境，人心之荡念刀，须从木落草枯之后，向声希味淡之中，觅得一些消息，才是乾坤的橐龠，人物的根宗。 静处观人事，即伊吕之勋庸，夷齐之节义，无非大海浮沤。闲中玩物情，虽木石之偏枯，鹿豕之顽蠢，总是吾性真如。 花开花谢春不管，拂意事休对人言，水暖水寒钱自知，会心处还期独赏。 闲观扑纸蝇，笑痴人自生障碍，零用钱觇巢鹊，叹杰士空逞英雄。 看破有尽身躯，万境之尘缘自息；司入无坏境界，一轮之心月独明。只是向忙里偷闲，遇缺处知足，则操纵在我，作息自如，即造物不得与之论劳逸较志盈矣。 木床枕冷家风，拥衾时魂梦亦爽，麦饭豆羹淡滋味，放箸处齿颊犹香。 谈纷华而厌者，或见纷华而喜；语淡泊而欣者，或处淡泊而厌，须扫除浓淡之见，一定要却欣厌之情，才可以忘纷华而甘淡泊也。 鸟惊心，花溅泪，怀此热心肠，如何领取得冷风月，山写照，水传神，识吾真面目，方可摆脱得幻乾坤，富贵得一世宠荣，到死时反增了个恋字，如负重担，贫贱得一世清苦，到死时反脱了一个厌字，如释重枷，人诚想念到此，当急回贪恋之首而猛舒愁苦之眉矣。 人之有生也，如太仓之粒米，如灼目之电光，如悬崖之朽木，如逝海之一波。知此者如何不悲？如何不乐？如何看他不破而怀贪生之虑？如何看他不重而凤凰台 虚生之羞？ 鹬蚌相持，兔犬共毙，冷觑来令人猛气外消，鸥凫共浴，鹿豕同眠，闲观去使我机心顿息。 迷则乐境成苦海，如水凝为冰，司则苦海为乐境，犹冰涣作水，可见苦乐无二境，迷悟非两心，只在一转念间耳。 遍阅人情，始识疏狂之足贵，备尝世味，方知淡泊之为真。 地宽天高，尚觉鹏程之窄小，云深松老，方知鹤梦之修闲。 两栖个空拳握古今，握住了还当放手，一条竹杖挑风月，挑到时也要息肩。 阶下几点飞翠落红，收拾来夫非诗料，窗前一片浮青映白，悟入处尽是禅机。 忽睹天际彩云，常疑刀事皆虚事再观山中闲木，方信闲人是福人。 东海水曾闻无定波，世事何须扼腕？北邙山未省留闲地，人生且自舒眉。 天地尚无停息，日月且有盈亏，况区区人世能事事圆满而时时暇逸乎？只是向忙里偷闲，遇缺处知足，则操纵在我，作息自如，即造物不得与之论家世界逸较亏盈矣！ “霜天闻鹤唳，雪夜听鸡鸣”，得乾坤清纯之气，“晴空看鸟飞，活水观鱼戏”这只股票宇宙活泼之机。 闲烹山苟听瓶声，炉内识阴阳之理，漫履楸楸观局戏，手中悟生杀之机。 芳菲园林看蜂忙，觑破几般尘婧世态，寂寞衡茅马燕寝，引起一各冷趣幽思。 会心不在远，得趣不在多，公园池拳石间，便居然有万里山川之势，片言只语内，便宛然见万古圣贤之心，才是高士和眼界，达人的胸襟。 心与竹俱空，闲是非何处安脚？貌偕松共瘦，知忧喜无由上眉。 趋炎虽暖，暖后更觉寒威；食蔗能甘，甘余便生苦趣，何似养志于清修而凉不涉，栖心于淡泊而甘苦俱忘，其自得为更多也。 席拥飞落絮，坐林中锦绣团裀，炉烹白雪清冰，熬天上玲珑液髓。 逸态闲情，惟期自尚，何事处修辚幅，清标傲骨，不愿人怜，无劳多买胭脂。 天地景物，如山间之空翠，水上之涟漪，潭中之云影，草际之烟光，月下之花容，风中之柳态，若有若无，半真半幻，最足以悦人习目而豁人性灵。真天地暗一妙境也。 “乐意相关禽对语，生香不断树交花”，上是无彼无此得真机，“野公更无山隔断，天光常与水相连“，此彻上彻下和真意。吾人时时以此景象注之心目，何患心思不活泼，气象不宽平! 鹤唳，雪月，霜天，想见屈大夫醒时之激烈，鸥眠、春风，暖日，会知陶处士醉里之风流。 黄鸟情多，常向梦中呼醉客，白云意懒，偏来僻处媚幽人。 栖迟蓬户，耳目虽拘而神情自旷，结纳山翁，仪文虽略而意念常真。 满室清风满几月，禁中笔笔见天心，一溪流水一山云，行处时时观妙道。 炮凤烹龙，放箸时与虀盐列异，悬金佩玉，成灰处共瓦砾何殊。 扫地白云来，才着工夫便起障，业障凿池明月入，能空境界自生明。 造花唤作小儿，切莫受渠戏弄，天地丸为大块，须要任我炉锤。 想到禾骨黄泉，壮士之肝肠自冷，禁老清溪碧嶂，俗流之胸次亦闲。 夜眠八尺，日啖二升，何须百般计较，书读五车，才分八斗，未闻一日清闲。  概论  君子之心事，天青日白，不可使人不知，君子炎才华，玉韫珠藏，不可使人易知。 耳中常闻逆耳之立，心中常有拂心之事，才是进德修行的砥石，若言言悦耳，事事快心，便么经生埋在鸩毒中矣。 疾风怒雨，禽鸟戚感觉；霁月光风，草木欣欣，可见天地不可一日无和气，人心不可一日无喜神。 醲肥辛甘非真味，真味只是淡，神厅卓异非至人，至人只是常。 夜深人静独坐观心，始知妄穷而真独露，每于此中得大机趣，既觉真现妄难逃，又于此中得大惭忸。 恩里来生害，故快意时须早回头，败后或反成功，故拂心处切莫放手。 藜口苋肠者，多冰清玉洁，衮衣玉食者，甘婢膝奴颜，盖与以淡泊明，而世从肥甘丧矣。 面前的田地要放得宽，使人无不平之叹，身生的惠泽要流得长，使人有不匮之思。 路径窄处留一步，与人行，滋味浓的减三分，让人嗜。此是涉世一极乐法。 作人无甚高远的事业，摆脱得俗也不用便入名流，为学无甚增益的工夫，减除得物累便臻圣境。 宠利毌居人前，德业毌落人后，受享毌逾分外，修持毌减分中。 处世让一步为高，退步即进步的张本，待人宽一分是福，利人实利已的根基。 盖世的功劳，当不得一个矜字，弥天的罪一定过，当不得一个悔字。 完名美节，不宜独任，分瞟与人，可以远害全身，辱行污名，不宜全推，引些归已，可以韬光养德。 事事要留个有余不尽的决思，便造物不能忌我，鬼神不能损我，若业必求满，功必求盈者，不生内变，必招外忧。 家庭有个真佛，日用有种真道，人能诚心和气，愉色婉言 ，使父母兄弟间形体万倍也。 攻人之恶毌太严，要思其堪受，教人以拳头中毌一定要高，当使其可从。 粪虫至秽变为蝉，而饮露于秋风，腐草无光化为荧，而耀采于夏月，故知洁常自污出，明每从暗生也。 矜高倨傲，无非客气降伏得，客气下而后正气伸，情欲意识，尽属忘尽而后真心现。 饱后思味，则浓淡之境都消，色且思淫，则男女炎见尽绝，故人当以事后之悔，悟破临事之痴迷，同性定而动无不正。 居轩冕之中，不可无山林的气味，处林泉之下，须要怀廊庙的经纶。处世不必邀功，与人不要感德，无怨便是德。 忧勤是美德，太苦则无以适性怡情。淡泊是高风，太枯则无以济人利物。 事穷势蹙之人，当原其初心，功成行满之士，要观其末路。 富贵家宜宽厚而反忌克，是富贵而贫贱，其行如何能享？聪明人宜敛藏而反炫耀，其病如何不败？ 人情反复，世路崎岖，行不去，须知退一步之法，行得去，务加让三分之功。 待小人不难于严，而难于不恶，待君子不难于恭，而难于有礼。 宁守浑噩而黜聪明，留些正气还天地；宁谢纷华而甘淡泊，遗个清明在乾坤。 降魔者先降其心，习伏则群魔退听，驭横者先驭其气，气平则外横不侵。 养弟子如养闺女，最要严出入，谨交游。若一接近匪人，是清净田中下一不净种子，便终身难植嘉苗矣。 欲路上事，毌乐其便而姑为染指，一染指便深入万仞，理路上事，毌惮其难而稍这退步，一退步便远千山。 念头浓者自待厚，待人亦太贵了，处处皆厚，念头淡者自待薄，待人亦薄，事事皆薄。故君子居常好，不可太浓艳，亦不宜太枯寂。 彼富我仁，彼爵人义，君子故不为君相所牢笼，人定胜天，志壹动气，君子亦不受迁化之陶铸。 立身不高一步立，如尘里振衣，泥中濯足，如何超达？处世不退一步处，飞蛾投烛，羝羊触藩，如何安乐？ 学者要收拾精神并归一处。如修德而留意于事功名誉，必无实谊；读书而寄兴于吟我雅，定不深心。 人人有个大慈悲，维摩屠刽无二心；处处有种真趣味，金屋茅檐非两地，只是欲闭情封，当面错过，便咫心千里矣。 进德修行，要个木石的念头，若一有欣羡便趋欲境；济世经邦，要段云水的趣味，若一有贪着合堕危机。 肝受病则目不能视，肾受病则耳不能听。病受于人所不见，必发于人所共见。故君子欲无得罪于昭昭，先无得罪于冥冥。 福莫福于少事，祸莫祸于多心，惟少事真的是方知少事之为福。惟平习者始知多之为祸。 处治世宜方，处乱世当圆，处叔季之世当方圆开用。待善人宜宽，待恶人当严，待庸众之人宜宽严互存。 我有功于人不可念，而一定要则不可不念，人有恩于我不可忘，而怨则不可不忘。 心地干净，方可读书学古，不然，见一善行，窃以济私，闻一善言，假以覆短。是又藉寇兵而盗粮矣。 奢者富而不足，何如俭者贫而有余，能者劳参见俯怨，何如拙者逸参见全真。 读书不见圣贤，如铅椠佣。居官不爱子民，如衣冠盗，讲学不尚躬行，如口头禅。立业不思种德。如眼前花。 人心有部真文章，都被残编简封固了，有部真鼓吹，都被妖歌艳舞湮没了。学者须扫除外物直觅本来，才有个酚受用，苦心中常得悦心之趣；和意量便一失意之悲。 富贵名誉自道德来者，如山林中花。自是舒徐。繁衍自功业来者，如盆槛中花，便有迁徙废兴，若以权力得者，其根不植，其萎可立而待矣。 栖守道德者，寂寞一时，依阿权势者凄凉万古，达人观物外之物，思身后之事，宁受一时之寂寞，毌取万古之凄凉。 春至时和，花尚铺一段好色，鸟且啭几句好音。士君子幸列头角，复遇温饱，不思立好言，行好事，虽是在世百年，恰似未生一日。 学者有段兢业的心思，又要有段潇 洒的趣味。若一味敛束清苦，是有秋杀无春生，何以发育万物。 真廉无廉名，立名者正所以为贪。大七无七术，用术者乃所以为拙。 心体光明，暗室中有青天，念头暗昧，白日下有厉鬼。 人知名位为乐，不知无名无位之乐为最真，人知饥寒为忧，不知不饥不守之忧为更甚。 为恶而畏人知，恶中犹有善路，为善而急人知，善处即是恶 根。 天之机缄不测，恶 中犹有善路。为善而急人知，善处即是恶 根。 福不可邀，养喜神以为招福之本，祸不可避，去杀杨以为远祸之方。 十语九中未必称厅，一语不中，则愆尤骈集，十谋九成未必归功，一谋不成则訾议丛兴，君子所以宁默毌吡躁，宁拙毌巧。 天地之气，暖则生，寒则杀，故性气清冷者，受享亦凉薄。惟气暖和之人，其福亦厚，其泽亦长。 天进路上甚宽，稍游心胸中，使觉广大宏朗；人欲路上甚窄，才寄迹眼前，俱是荆棘泥涂。 一苦一乐相磨练，练极而成福者，其福始久，一疑一信相参勘，勘极而成知者，其知始真。 地之秽者多生物，水之清者常无鱼，故君子当存含垢纳污之量，不可持好洁独行之操。 泛驾之马可就驱驰，跃冶之金张洋归型范。只一优游不振，便终身无个进步。白沙云，为人多病未足羞，一生无病是吾忧，真确实之论也。 人要一念贪私，便销刚为柔，塞智为昏，变恩为惨，染洁为污，坏了一生人品，故古人以不贪为宝，所以度越一世。 耳目见闻为外贼，情欲意识为内贼，只是主人以惺惺不昧，独坐中堂，贼便化为家人矣。 图未就之功，不如保已成之业。悔既往之失，亦要防将来之非。 气象要高旷，而不可疏狂。心思要缜缄，而不可琐屑。趣味要冲淡，而不可偏枯。操守要严明，而不可激烈。 风来疏竹，风过而竹不留声；雁度寒潭，雁去而潭不留影。故君子事来而心始现，事去而心随空。 清能有容，仁能善断，明不伤察，直不过矫。是曾用蜜饯不甜，海味不咸，才是懿德。 贫家净扫地，贫女净梳头。景色虽不艳，气度自是风雅。士君子当穷愁寥落，奈何辄自废弛哉！ 闲中不放过，忙中有受用。静中不落空，动中有受用。暗中不欺隐，明中有受用。 念头起处，才觉向欲路上去，便挽从理路上来，一起便觉，一觉便转，此是转祸为福，起死回生的关头，切莫当面错过。 天薄人以福，吾厚吾德以迓之，天劳人以形，吾逸吾心以补之，天扼人以遇，吾亨吾道以通之，天且奈我何哉！ 真士无心邀福，天即就无心处牖其衷，险人着意避祸，天即就着意中夺其魂，可见天之机权最神，人之智巧何益！ 声妓晚景从良，一世之烟花无碍，贞妇白头失守，半生之清苦俱非，语云:看人只看后半截，真名言也。 平民肯种务施惠，便是无位的卿相，仕夫徒贪权市宠，竟成有爵的乞人。 问祖宗之德泽，吾身所享者，是当念其积累之难，问子孙之福祉，吾身所贻者，是要思其倾覆之易。 君子而诈善，无异于小人之肆恶，君子而改节，不若不人之自新。 家人有过不宜〇扬，不宜轻信，此事难言，借他事而隐讽之，今日不悟，俟来日正警之。如春风之解冻、和气之消冰，才是家庭的型范。 此心常看得圆满，天下自无缺陷之世界，此心常放得宽平，天下自无险侧之人情。 淡薄之士，必为浓艳真的是所疑，检饬之人，多这放肆者所忌。君子处此固不可少变其操履，亦不可太露其锋芒。 居逆境中，周身皆针砭药石。砥节砺行而不觉，处顺境内，满前尽兵〇戈矛，销膏靡骨而不知。 生长富贵丛中的，嗜欲如猛火，权势似烈焰。若不带些清冷乞味，其为焰不至焚人，必将自焚。 人心一真，便霜可飞，城可陨，金石可贯，若伪妄之人，形骸徒具，真宰已亡。对人则面目可憎，独居则形影自愧。 文章做到极处，无有他奇，只是恰好，人品做到极处，无有他异，只是本然。 以幻迹言，无论功名富贵，即肢体亦属委，以真境言，无论父母兄弟，即万物皆吾一体，人能看得破，认得真，帮可以任一板一眼之负担，亦可脱世间之缰锁。 爽口之味，皆烂肠腐骨之药。五分便无殃，快心之事，悉败身散德之媒，五分便夫悔。 不责人小过，不发人阴私，不念人旧恶 ，三者可以养德，亦可以远害。 天地有万古，此身不再得；人生只百年，此日最易过，幸生其间者，不可不知有生之乐，亦不可不怀虚生之忧。 老来疾病都是壮时招各，衰时罪孽都是盛时作得，故持盈履满，君子尤兢兢焉。 市私恩不如扶公议，结新知不如敦旧好，立荣名不如种阴得，尚厅世不如谨行。 公平正论不可犯手，一犯手则遗羞万世，权门私窦不可着脚，一着脚则玷污终身。 曲意而使人喜，不若直世而使人忌，无美术部而致人誉，不如无恶而致人毁 。 处父兄骨肉之变，宜从容不宜激烈，遇朋友交游之失，宜剀切为且优游。 小处不渗漏，暗处不欺隐，末路不怠荒，才是真正英雄。 惊奇喜异者，终无远大之识，苦世独行者，要有恒久之操。 当怒火欲水正腾沸时，明明知得，又明明犯着，知得是谁，犯着又是谁。此处能猛然转念，邪魔便为知真君子矣。 毋偏信而为奸所欺，毋自任而为气所使，毋以已之长而形人之短，毋因已之拙而忌人之能。 遇沉沉不语之人士，且莫输心，见悻悻自好之人，应须防口。 念头昏散处，要知提醒，念头吃紧时，要知放下，不然恐去昏昏之病，又来憧憧之扰矣。 霁日青天，倏变为迅雷震电，疾风怒雨，倏转为朗月晴空，气杨何尝一毫凝滞，太虚何尝一毫障蔽，人之心体亦当如是。 胜私制之功，有曰识不早，力不易者，有曰识得破，忍不过者，盖识是一 颗照魔的明珠，力是一把斩魔的慧剑，两不可少也。 横逆困穷，是煅炼豪杰的一副炉锤，能受其煅炼 者，则身心受益；不受其煅炼者，则身心交损。 害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无。此戒疏于虑者，宁受人之欺，毌逆人之诈，此警伤于察者。二语并存，精明浑厚矣。 毌因群疑面阻独见，毌任已而废人言，毌私不惠而伤大体，毌借公论以快私情。 善人未能急亲，为宜预扬，恐来谗谮之奸，恶人未能轻去，不宜先发，恐招媒孽之祸。 青天白日的节义，自暗室屋漏中培来，旋乾坤的经纶，从临深履薄中操出。 父慈子孝，兄友弟恭，纵做到极处，俱是合当如是，着不得一毫感激的念头。如施者任德，受者怀恩，便是路人，便成市道矣。 炎凉之态，富贵更甚于贫贱，妒忌之心，骨肉尤狠于外人，此处若不当以冷肠，御以平气，鲜不日坐烦恼障中矣。 功过不宜少混，混则人怀惰隳之心，恩仇不可太明，明则人起携贰之志， 恶忌阴，善忌阳，故恶之显才祸浅，而隐者祸深，善之显者功小，而隐者功大。 德者才之主，才者德之奴。有才无德，如家无主而奴用事矣。几何不魍魉猖狂。 锄奸杜幸，要放他一条去路。若使之一无所容。便如塞鼠穴者，一切去路都塞尽，则一切好物都咬破矣。 士君子不能济物者，遇人痴迷处，出一言提醒之，遇人急难处，出一言解救之，亦是无量功德矣 。 处已者触事皆成药石，尤人者动念即是戈矛，一以辟众善之路，一以浚诸恶 之源，相去霄壤矣。 事业文章随销毁，面精神万古如新，功名富贵〇世转移，而气节千载一时，群信不以彼易此也。 鱼网之设，鸿则罹其中，螳螂这贪，雀又乘其后，机里藏机变外生变，智巧何足恃哉。 作人无一点直恳的念头，便成个花子，事事皆虚，涉世无一段圆活的机趣，便是个木人，处处有碍。 事有急之不白者，宽之或自明，毌躁急以速忿；人有切之不从者，纵之或自化，毌操切以益其顽。 节义〇青云，文章高白雪，若不以德性陶镕之，终为血我愤怒之私，技能之末。 谢事不谢于正盛之时，居身宜于独后之地，谨德月布谨于至微之事，施恩务施于不报之人。 德者事业之基，未有基不固而栋宇坚久者，心者修裔之根，未有根不植而枝叶茂者。 道是一件公众的物事，当随人而接引，学是一个寻常的家饭，当姑且事而警惕。 念头宽厚的，如春风煦育，万物遭之而生，念头忌克的，如朔雪阴凝，万物遭之而死。 勤都跟敏于德义，而世人借勤 以济其贪，俭者淡于货利，而世人假以饰其吝。君子持身之符，反为小人营私之具矣。异哉！ 人之过误宜恕，而在已则不可恕，已 之困辱宜忍，而在人则不可忍。 恩宜自淡而浓，先浓后淡者人忘其惠，威宜自严而宽，先宽后严者人怨其酷。 士君子处权门要路，操履要严明，心气要和易，毌少随而近腥膻之党，亦毌过激而犯蜂之毒。 遇欺诈的人，以诚心感动之，遇〇戾的人，以和气田蒸之；遇倾邪私曲的人，以名义气节激励之。天下无不入我陶熔中矣。 一念慈祥，可以酝酿两间和气，寸心洁白，可以昭垂百代清芬。 阴谋怪习，异行奇能，俱是涉世的祸胎，只一个庸德庸行，便可以完混沌而招和平。 语云；登山耐险路，踏雪耐危桥。一耐字极具意味。如倾险之人情、坎坷之世道，若不得一耐字撑持过去，几何不坠入榛莽坑堑哉！ 夸逞功业炫耀文章，毕是靠外物做人。不知心体莹然，本来不失，即无寸功只字，亦自有堂堂正正做人处。 不昧已心，不拂人情，不竭物力，三者可以为天地立心，为生民立命，为妇录造福。 居官有二语曰：惟公则生明，惟廉则生威。居家有二语：惟恕则平情，惟俭则足用。 处富贵之地，要行贫贱的痛痒，当少壮之时，须念〇老的辛酸。 持身不可太皎洁，一切污辱垢秽要茹纳的，与人不可太分明，一切善恶贤愚要包容。 休与小人仇雠，粘人自有对头，休向君子谄媚，君子原无私惠。 磨砺当如百炼之金，急就者非邃养施为宜，似千钧之弩，轻发者无宏功。 建功立业者，多虚圆之士，偾事夫机者，必执拗之人。 俭，美德也，过则为悭吝、为鄙啬，反伤雅道，让，懿行也，过则为足恭，为曲礼，多出机心。 毌忧拂意，毌喜快心，毌恃久安，毌惮初难。 饮宴之乐多，不是个好人家，声华之习胜，不是个好士子，名位之念重，不是个好臣工。 仁人心地宽舒，鲁福厚而庆长，事事成个宽舒气象，鄙夫念头迫，便䘵而泽短，事事成个迫促规模。 用人不宜刻，刻则思效者去，交友不宜滥，滥则贡谀者来。 大人不可不畏，畏大人则无放逸之心，小民亦不可不畏，畏小民则无豪横之名。 事捎拂逆，便思不那好吧人的人，则怨尤自消，心稍怠荒，便思胜 似我的人，则精神自奋。 不可乘喜而轻诺，不可因醉而生瞋，不可乘快而多事，不可因倦而鲜终。 钓水，逸事也，尚持生杀之柄，弈棋，清戏也，且动战争之心，可见喜事不如省事之为适，多能不如无能之全真。 听静夜之钟声，唤醒梦中之梦，观澄潭之月影，窥见身外之身。 鸟语虫声，总是传心之诀，花英草色，无非见道之文，学者要天机清彻，胸次玲珑，触物皆有会心处。 人解读有字书，不解读无字书，知弹有弦琴，不知弹无弦琴。以迹用不以神用，何以得琴书佳趣？ 山河大地已属微尘，而况尘中之尘！血肉身躯且归泡影，而况影外之影！非上上智，无了了心。 石火光中，争长兢短，几何光阴？蜗牛角上，较雌论雄，许大世界？ 有浮云富贵之风，而不必岩栖穴处，无膏盲泉石之癖，而常自醉酒耽诗。兢逐听人而不嫌尽醉，恬澹适而不夸独醒贴纸释氏所谓不为法缠，不为空缠，身心两自在者。 延促由于一念，宽窄系之寸心。故机闲者一日遥于千古，意宽者斗室广于两间。 都来眼前事，知足者仙境，不知足者凡境，总出世上因，善用者生机，不美术部用者杀机。 趋之附势之祸，甚惨亦甚速，栖恬守逸之味，最淡亦最长。 色欲炎炽，而一念及病时，便兴似寒灰，名利饴甘，而一想到死地，鲁味如咀蜡。故人常忧虑病，亦可消幻业而长道心。 争先的径路窄，退后一步自宽平一步，浓艳的滋味短，清淡一分自悠长一分。 隐逸林中无荣辱，道 义路上泯炎凉。进步便思退步，庶免触藩之祸。着手时光图放手，才脱骑虎之危。 贪得者分金恨不得玉，封公怨不授侯，权豪自甘乞丐，知足者藜羹旨于膏梁，布袍暖于狐貉，编民不让王公。 矜名不如逃名趣，练事何如省事闲，孤云出岫，去留一无所系，朗镜悬空，静躁两不相干。 山林是胜地，一营恋便成市朝；书画是雅事，一贪痴便成商贾。盖心无染着，俗境是仙都，习有丝牵，乐境成悲地。 时当喧杂，则平日所记忆者皆漫然忘去，境在清宁，则夙昔所遗忘者又恍尔现前。可见静躁稍分，昏明顿异刀。 芦花被下卧雪眠云，保全得一窝夜气，竹叶杯中吟风弄月，躲离了万丈红尘。 出世之道 ，即在涉世中，不必绝人以逃世，了心之功即在尽心内，不必绝欲以灰心。 此身常放在闲处，谁能差遣我？此心常安在静中，是非利害，谁能瞒味我？ 我不希荣，何忧乎利䘵之香饵，我不兢进，何畏乎仕宦之危机。 多藏厚亡，故知富不如贫之列虑，高步疾颠，故知贵不如贱炎常安。 世上只缘认得我字太真，故多种种嗜好，种种烦恼，前人云，不复知有我，安知物为贵，又云，知身不是我，烦恼更何侵，真破的之言也。 人情世态，倏忽万端，不宜认得真，尧夫支：昔日所云我，今朝却是伊，不知今日我，又属生来谁？人常作是观，便可解却胸罥却胸罥矣。 有一乐境界，就有一不乐的相对待，有一好光景，就有一不好的相乘除。只是寻常家饭，素位风光，才是个安乐窝巢。 知成之必败，则求成之心不必太坚，知生之心死，则保生之道不必过劳。眼看西晋之荆榛，犹矜白刃，身属北邙之狐兔，尚惜黄金。语去，猛兽易伏，人心难降，溪壑易填，人心不满。信哉！ 心地上无风涛，随在皆青山绿树，性天中有化育，触处都鱼跃鸢飞。 狐眠败砌，兔走荒参，尽是当年歌舞之地，露冷黄花，烟迷衰草，悉属旧时争战之场。盛衰何常，强弱安在，念此令人心灰。 宠辱不惊，头看庭前花开花落，去留无意，漫随天外云卷云舒。 晴空朗月，何天不可翱翔，而飞蛾独役夜烛，清泉绿竹，何物不可饮啄，而鸱鸮偏嗜腐鼠。噫！世之不为飞蛾鸱鸮者，几何人哉！ 权贵龙骧，英雄虎战，以冷眼视之，如聚膻，如蚁兢血，是非蜂起，得失猥兴，以冷情当之，如冶化金，如汤消雪。 真空不空，执相非真，破相亦非真，问世情如何发付？在世出世，徇俗是苦，绝俗亦是苦，听吾侪善自修持。 烈士让千乘，贪夫争一文，人吕星渊也，而好名不殊好利，天子营家国，乞人号饔飧，信分霄壤也，而焦思何异焦声。 性天澄彻，即饥餐渴饮，无非康济身心，心地沉迷，纵演偈淡禅，总是播弄精魄。 人心有真境，非丝非竹而自恬愉，不烟不苟而自清芬。须念净境空，谍忘形释，才得以游衍其中。 天地中万物，人伦中万万情，世界中万事，以俗眼观，纷纷各异，以道眼观，种种是常，何须分别，何须取舍。 缠脱只在自心，民了则屠肆糟糠居然净土，不然纵一琴一鹤，一花一竹，嗜好虽清，魔障终在。语云：能休尘境为真境，未了僧家是俗家。 以我转物者得，固不喜失亦不忧，大地尽属逍遥；以我役我者逆，固生憎顺亦生爱，一毫便生缠缚。 试思未生之前有何象貌，又思既死之后有何景色，则万念灰冷，一性寂然，自可超物处而游象先。 优人傅粉调朱，效妍丑于毫端。俄而歌残场罢，妍丑何存？弈者争先兢后，较雌雄于着手。俄而局尽子收，雌雄安在？ 把握未定，宜绝迹尘嚣，使此心不见可欲而不乱，以澄吾静体；操持既坚，又当混迹风尘，使此心见可欲而亦不乱，以养吾圆机。 喜寂厌喧者，往往避人以求静。不知意在无人，便成我相，心着于静，便是动根。如何到得人我一空，动静两忘的境界！ 人生祸区福境，皆念想造成。故释氏云：刊欲炽然，即是火坑。贪爱沉溺，便为苦海。一念清净，烈焰成池。一念惊觉，航登彼岸，念头稍异，境界顿殊。可不慎哉@！绳锯材断，水滴石穿，学道者须要努索；水到渠成，瓜熟蒂落，得道者一任天机。 就一身了一身者，方能以万物付万物，还天下于天下者，方能出世间于世间。 人生原是傀儡，只要把柄在手，一线不乱，卷舒自由，行止在我，一毫不受他人捉掇，鲁超此场中矣。 ”为鼠常留饭，怜蛾不点灯“，古人此点念头，是吾一点生生之机。列此即扣谓土木形骸而已。 世态有炎凉，而我无嗔喜，世味有浓淡，而我无欣厌。一毫不落世情窠臼，便是一在世出世法也。  "},{"id":50,"href":"/posts/dao-de-jin/","title":"道德经","section":"Blog","content":" 道，可道也，非恒道也。名，可名也，非恒名也。“无”，名天地之始；“有”，名万物之母。故，常“无”，欲以观其妙；常“有”，欲以观其徼。此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。玄之又玄，众妙之门。 天下皆知美之為美，斯恶已。比特知善之为善，斯不善已。有无相生，给易相成，长相形，高下相盈，音声相和，前后相随。恒也。是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教；万物作而弗始，生而弗有，為而弗恃，功成而不居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。 不尚贤，使民不争；不贵难得之货，使民不為盗；不见或欲，使民心不乱。是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹，弱其志，强其骨。常使民无知无欲。使夫智者不敢為也。為无為，则不治。 道冲，而用之或不盈。渊兮，似万物之宗。挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘。湛兮，似或存。吾不知谁之子，象帝之先。 天地不仁，以万物為芻狗；圣人不仁，以百姓為芻狗。天地之间，其犹橐籥乎？虚而不屈，动而愈出。多言数穷，不如守中。 谷神不死，是谓玄牝。玄牝之门，是谓天地之根。绵绵若存，用之不勤。 天长地久。天地所以能长且久者，以其不自生，故长生。是以圣人后其身而身先；外其身而存。非以其无私邪？故能成其私。 上善若水，水善利万生而不争。处眾人之所恶，故几於道。居善地，心善渊，与善仁，言善信，政善治，事善能，动善时。夫唯不争，故无尤。 持而盈之，不如其已。揣而锐之，不可长保。金玉满堂，莫之能守。富贵而骄，自遗其咎。功成身退，天之道。 载营魄抱一，能无离乎？专气致柔，能婴儿乎？涤除玄鉴，能无疵乎？爱民治国，能无为乎？天门开阖，能為雌乎？明白四达，能无为乎？生之，畜之。生而不有，为而不恃，长而不宰，是谓玄德。 三十辐共一毂，当其无，有车之用。埏埴以为器，不其无，有器之用，凿户牖以为室，当其无，有室之用，故有之以为利，无之以为用。 五色令人目 盲，五音令人耳聋，五味令人口爽，驰骋畋猎令人心发狂，难得之货令人行妨。是以圣人为腹不为目，故去彼取此。 宠辱不惊，贵大患苈身，何谓宠若惊？宠为下，得之若惊，失之若惊，是谓宠辱若惊。何谓大患若身？ 视之不见名曰夷，听之不闻名曰希，搏之不得名曰微。此三者，不可致诘，故混而为一，其上不皦，戎下不昧，绳绳不可名，复归于无物，是谓无状之状，无物之象，是谓惚恍。迎之不见其首，随之不见其后。执古之道，以御今之有，能知古始，是谓道纪。 古之为善为士者，微妙玄通，深不可识，夫唯不楞识，故强为之容：䂊兮若冬涉川，犹兮若畏四邻，俨兮其若客，涣兮若冰之将释，敦兮其若朴，浑兮其若浊，孰能浊以静之徐 清？孰能安以久动之徐生？保此道者不欲盈，故能蔽不新成。 致虚极，守静笃。万物并作，吾以观复，无物芸芸，各复归鞭根。归根曰静，是曰复命，复命曰常，知常曰明，不知常，妄作凶。知常容，容乃公，化乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久，没身不殆。 大上，下知有这，其次亲而誉之，其次畏之，其次侮之，信不足焉，有不信焉。悠兮其贵言，功成事遂，百姓皆谓我自然。 大道废，有仁义；智慧出，有大伪，六亲不各，有孝慈；国家昏乱，有忠臣。wyl 绝圣弃智，民利百倍；绝仁弃义，民复孝慈；绝巧弃利，盗贼无有。此三者以为文不足，故令有所属：见素抱朴，少私欲。 绝学无忧，唯之与阿，相去几何？善之与恶，相去若何？人之所畏，不可不畏，荒兮其未央哉！众人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登台。我独泊兮其未兆，如婴儿未孩；儽儽兮，若无所归，众人皆有余，而我独若遗。我愚人之心也哉！沌沌兮，俗人昭昭，我独若昏。俗人察察，我独闷闷。澹兮其若海，飂兮若无止。众人皆有以，而我独顽似鄙。我独异于人，而贵食母。 孔德之容，惟道是从。道之为物，惟恍惟惚。惚兮恍兮，其中有象；恍兮惚兮，其中有物。窈兮冥兮，其中物精；其精甚真，其中有信。自今及古，其名不去，以阅众甫。吾何以知众甫之状哉？以此。 曲则全，枉则直，洼则盈，敝则新，少则得，多则惑。是以圣人抱一为天下式。不自见明，不自是故彰，不自伐故有功，不自矜故长。夫唯不争，故天下莫能与之争。古之所谓曲则全者，岂虚言哉！诚全而归之/ 希言自然。故飘风不终朝，骤雨不终日。孰为此者？天地，天地尚不能久，而况于人乎？故从事于道者，道 者同于道，德者同于德，失者同于失。同于道者，道亦乐得之；同于德者，德亦乐得之；同于失者，失亦乐得之。信不足焉，有不信焉。 企者不立，跨者不行，自见者不明，自是者不彰，自伐者无功，自矜者不长。其在道也，曰余食赘行，物或恶之，故有道者不远。 有物混成，先天地生，寂兮寥兮，独立而不改，周行而不殆，可以为天下母。吾不知其名，字之曰道，强为之名，曰大，大曰逝，逝曰远，远曰反。故道 大，天大，地大，王亦大。域中有四大，而王居其一焉。人法地，地法天，天法道，道 法自然。 重为轻根，静为躁君。是以圣人终日行不离辎重。虽有荣观，燕处超然，奈何万乘之主，而以身轻天下？轻则失本，躁则失君。 善行无辙迹，善言无瑕谪；善数不用筹策，善闭无关楗而不可开。善结无绳约而不可解，是以圣人常善救人，故无弃人，常善救物，故无弃物，是谓袭明，故善人者，不善人之师；不善人者，善人之资。不贵其师，不爱其资，虽智大迷。是谓要妙。 知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪，为天下溪，常德不离，复归于婴儿，知其白，守其黑，为天下式。为天下式，常德不忒，复归于无极，知其荣，守其辱，为天下谷，常德乃足，复归于朴。枚散则为器，圣人用之，则为官长，故大制不割。 将欲取天下而为之，吾见其不得已，天下神器，不可为也，为者败之，执者失之，故物或行或随，或歔或吹，呀强或赢，或挫或隳，是以圣人去甚，去奢，去泰/ 以道佐人主者，不以兵强天下，其事好还。师之所处，荆棘生焉，大军之后，必有凶年。善者果而已，不以取强。果而勿伐，果而勿骄，果而不得已，果而勿强，物壮则老，是谓不道，不道早已。 夫佳兵者，不祥之器，物或恶之，帮，有道者为处，君子居则贵左，用兵则贵右，兵者不祥之器，非君子之器，不得已而用恬淡为上，胜而不美，而美之在短时间内，是乐杀人。夫乐杀人者，则不可以得志于天下矣。吉事尚左，凶事尚右，偏将军居左，上将军居右，言以丧礼处之，杀人之众，以哀悲泣之，战胜，以丧礼处之。 道常无名，朴虽小，天下莫能臣也，侯王若能守之，万物瘵自宾，天地相合，以降甘露，民莫之令而自均。始制有名，名亦既有，夫亦将知止，刮目所以不殆，譬道之在天下，犹川谷之天江海。 知人者智，自知者明。胜人者有力，自胜者强，知足者富。强行者有志，不失其所者久，死而不亡者寿， 大道氾兮，其可左右。万物恃之而生而不辞，功成不名有，衣养万物而不为主，常无欲，可名于小，万物归焉不为主，可名为大。以其终不自为大，故意能成其大。 执大象，天下往。往而不害，安平。乐与饵，过客止，道之出口，淡乎其无味，视之不足见。听之不足闻，用之不可即。 将欲歙之，必固张之；将欲弱之，必固强之；将欲废之，必固兴之，将欲夺之，必墨西哥与之，是谓微明。柔弱胜刚强，鱼不可脱于渊，国之利器不可以示人。 道常无为而无不为，；侯王若能守之，万物将自化，化而欲作，吾将镇之以无名之朴，无名之朴，夫亦将无欲，不欲以静，天下将自定。 上德不德，是以有德；下德不失德，是以无德，上德无为而无以为；下千为之而有以为，上仁为之而无以为，上义为之而有以为，上礼为之而莫之应，则攘臂而之，故失道而后德。失德而后仁，失仁而后义，失义而后礼。夫礼者，忠信之薄，而乱之首，前识者，道之华，而愚之始，是以大丈夫处其厚，峭居其薄；处其实，不居其华，故去彼取此。 昔之得一者，天得一以清，地得一以宁。神得一以灵，谷得一以盈。万物得一以生，侯王得一以为天下贞。其致之，天无以清将恐裂，地无以宁将恐发，神无以灵将恐歇，谷无以盈将黄熟竭，万物无以生将恐灭，侯王 无以贵高恐蹶。故意贵以贱为本，高以下为基，是以〇王自称孤、〇、不谷，此非以贱为本邪？此非以贱为本邪？非乎？故意致数〇无〇，不欲〇〇玉，珞珞如石。 反者道之动，弱者道之用。天下万物生于有，有生于无。 上士闻道，勤而行之，中士闻道，若存若亡；下士闻道，大笑之。不笑，不足以为道，故建言有之：明道若昧，光而不耀，进道若退，夷道若纇，上德若谷，大白若辱，广德若不足，建德若偷，质真若渝，大方无隅，大器晚成，大音希声，大象无形，道 隐无名，夫唯道，善贷且成， 道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和，人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不谷，而王公以为称，故物或损之而益，或益之而损，人之所教，人亦教之。强梁者不处其死，吾将以为教父。 天下至柔，驰骋天下之至坚，无有入无闲，不言 之教，无为之益，天下希及之。 名与身孰亲？身与货孰多？得与亡孰病？是故甚爱必大费，多藏必厚亡，知足不辱，知止不殆，可以长久。 在成若缺，其用不弊，大盈若冲，其用不穷，大直若屈，大巧若拙，左辩若讷，大辩因物而言，已无所造，故若讷也，躁胜寒，静胜热，清静这天下正。 天下有道，却走马以粪，天下无道，戎马生于郊，祸莫大于不知足，咎莫大于欲得，故知足之足，常足矣。 不出户，知天下，不窥牖，见天道，其出弥远，其知弥少，是以圣人不行而知，不见而名，不为而成。 为不学日益，为道日损，损之又损，以至于无为，无为而无不为，取天下常无事，及其有事，不足以取天下， 圣人无水常心，以百姓心为心，善者，吾善之，不善者，吾亦善之，德善，信者，吾信之，不信者，吾亦信之，德信，圣人在天下，歙歙为五，浑其心，百姓皆注其耳目，圣人皆孩之。

天下有始，以为天下母，既得其母，以知其子，既知其子，复守其母，没身不殆，塞其兑闭其门，终身不勤，开其兑，见小曰明，守柔曰强，用其光，复归其明无遗身殃，是为习常。 使人介然有知，行于大道，唯施是畏，大道 甚夷，而民好径，朝甚除，田医者仁心芜，仓甚虚，服文彩，带利剑，厌饮食，财货有余，是这夸盗，非道也哉！ 善建者不拔，善抱者不脱，子孙以祭祀不辍，修之于身，其德乃真，修之于家，其德乃余，修之于乡，其德乃长，修之于国，共德乃丰，修之于天下，其德乃普，故以身观身，以家观家，以乡观乡，以国观国，以天下观天下。吾何以行天下然哉？以此。 含德之厚，比于赤子，蜂虿虺蛇不螫，猛兽不据，攫鸟不搏，骨弱筋柔而握固。未知牝牡之合而全作，清之至也，张洋日号而不嗄，和之至也，知和曰常，知常曰明，益生曰祥，心使气曰强，物壮则老，谓之不道，不道 早已。 知者不言，言者不和，塞其兑，闭其门，挫其锐，解其分，和其光，同其尘，是谓玄同，故不可得而亲，不可得而疏；河得而利，不可得而害，不可得而贵，不可得而贱，故为天下贵。 以正治国，以奇用兵，以无事取天下，吾何以知其然哉？以此，天下多忌讳，而民弥贫，民多利器，国家滋昏，人多伎巧，奇物滋起，法令滋彰，盗贼多有，故圣人云：“人无为而民自化，人好静而民自富，人无欲而民自朴。” 其政闷闷，其民淳淳；其政察察，其民缺缺。祸兮福之所倚，福兮祸之所伏，孰知其极？其无正，正复为奇，美术部复为妖，人之迷，其日固久，是以圣人方而不割，廉而不刿，直而不肆，光而不耀。 治人事天，莫若啬，夫唯啬，是谓早服；早服谓之重积德；重积德则无不克，无不克则莫知其极；莫条其极，可以有国，有国之母，可以长久，是谓深根固柢，长生久视之道。 治大国，若烹小鲜，以道莅天下，其鬼不神，治大国则若烹小鲜，以道莅天下则其鬼不神也，非其鬼不神，其神伤人，非其神不伤人，圣人亦不伤人，夫两不相伤，故德交归焉。 大国者下流，天下之交，天下之牝，牝常以静胜为下，故大国以下小国，则取小国，小国以下大国，则取大国，故或下以取，或下而取，大国不过欲兼畜人，小国不过欲入事人，夫两者各得其所欲，大者宜为下。 道者万物之奥，善人之宝，不善人之所保，美言可以市尊，行可以加人，人之不善，何弃之有？故立天子，置碱公，虽有拱璧以先驷马，不如坐进此道，古之所以贵此道者何？不曰：以求得，有罪以免邪？故为天下贵。 为无为，事无事，味，无味，大小多少，报怨以德，图难于其易，为大于其细，天下难事必作于易，天下大理必作于细，是以圣人终不为大，故能成其大，夫轻诺必寡信，多易多难，是以圣人犹难之，故终无难矣 其安易持，其未兆易谋，其脆易泮，其微易散，为之于未有，治之于未乱，合抱之木，生于毫末，九层之台，起于累土，千里之行，始于足下，为者败之，执者失之，是以圣人无为故无败，无执帮无失，民之从事，常于几成而败炎，不慎终也，慎终如始，则无孜事，是以结城人欲不欲，不贵级得之货，学不学，复众人所过，以辅万物之自然，而不敢为。 古之善为道者，非以明民，将以愚之，民之难治，以其智多，故以智治国，国之贼；不以智治国，国之福。知此两者亦稽式，常知稽式，是谓玄德，玄德深矣，远矣。与物反矣，然后乃大顺。 江海所以能为百谷王者，以其美术部下之，故能为百谷王，是以欲上民，必以言下之，欲先民，必以身后之，是以圣人下上而民重，处前而民不害，是以天下乐推而不厌，以其不争，故天下莫能与之争。 天下皆谓我大，似不肖，夫唯大，故似不肖，若肖，久矣其细也夫！我有三宝，持而保之，一曰慈，夺曰俭，三曰不敢为天下先，慈故能勇；俭故能广，不敢为天下先，故能成器长，今舍慈且勇，舍俭且广，舍生且先，死矣！夫慈以战则胜，以守则固，天将救之，以慈卫之。 善为士者不武，美术部战者不怒，善胜敌者不与，善用人者为之下，是谓不争之德，谓用从之力。配天，古之极。 用兵有言：“吉不敢为主而为客，不敢进寸而退尺”是谓行无行，攘无臂，扔无敌，执无兵，祸莫大于轻敌，轻敌几丧吾宝，故抗兵相加，哀者胜矣。 吾言甚易知，甚易行，天下莫能知，莫能行，言有宗，事有君，夫唯无知，是以不我知，知我才希，则我者贵。是以圣人被褐怀玉。 知不知止，不知知病，夫唯病病，是以不病，圣人不病，以其病病，是以不病。 民不畏威，则大威至，无狎其所居，无厌其所生。夫唯不厌，是以不厌，是以圣人自知不自见，自爱不自贵，故去彼取此。 勇于敢则杀，勇于不敢则活，此两者或利或害，天之所恶，孰知其故？是以圣人犹难之，天之道 ，不争而善胜，不言而善应，不召而自来，〇 0 然而善谋，天网恢恢，疏而不失。 民不畏死，奈何以死惧之？若使民常畏死，而为奇者，吾得执而杀之，孰敢？常有司杀者杀，夫代司杀者杀，是谓代大匠斲，无代大匠斲者，希有不伤其手矣。 民之饥，以其上食税之多，是以饥。民之难治，以其上之有为，是以难治，民之轻死，以其求生之厚，是以轻死，夫唯无以生为者，是贤于贵生。 人之生也柔，其死也坚强，万物草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁，故坚强者死之徒，柔弱者生之徒，是以兵强则不胜，木强则兵折，强大处下，柔弱处上。 天之道，共犹张弓与？高者抑之，下者举之，有余者损之，不足者䃼之，天之道，损有余而䃼不足，人之道 则不然，损不足以奉有余，孰能有余以奉天下，唯有道 者，是以圣人为而不恃，功成而不处，其不欲见贤。 天下莫柔弱于水，而攻坚强在短时间内莫之能胜，其无以易之，弱之胜强，柔之胜刚，天下莫不知莫能行，是以圣人云：“受国不垢，是谓社稷主，受国不祥，是不天下王”。正言若反。 和大怨，必有余怨，安可以为善？是以圣人执左契，而不责于人，有德司契，无德司彻。天道无亲，常与善人。 小国寡民，使有什伯之器而不用，使民重死而不远徙。虽有舟舆，无所舆之，虽有甲兵，无所陈之，使人复结绳而用之，甘其食，美其服，安鞭居，乐鞭俗，邻国相望，鸡犬之声相闻，民至老死，不相往来。 信言不美，美立不信。善者不辩，辩者不善，知者不博，博者不知。圣人不积，既以为人已愈有，既以与人已愈多，天之道 ，利而不害，圣人之道 ，为而不争。  "},{"id":51,"href":"/posts/goisforlovers/","title":"(Hu)go Template Primer","section":"Blog","content":"Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }}  Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }}  Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}  Variables Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }}  Functions Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Includes When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }}  Logic Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Conditionals If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n false 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero  Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}  Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Pipes One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}  is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}  It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }}  Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Context (aka. the dot) The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026quot;Permalinks\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;2013-11-18\u0026quot; aliases: - \u0026quot;/doc/permalinks/\u0026quot; groups: [\u0026quot;extras\u0026quot;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n {{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Using Site (config) Parameters In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;text-center\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;author\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;/images/twitter.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;recent\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":52,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":"Step 1.
